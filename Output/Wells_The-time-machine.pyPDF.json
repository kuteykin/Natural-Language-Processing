    "4": "IntroductionThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding arecondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale facewas flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of theincandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed inour glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather thansubmitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, whenthought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in thisway\u2014marking the points with a lean forefinger\u2014as we sat and lazily admired hisearnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.\u201cYou must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that arealmost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school isfounded on a misconception.\u201d\u201cIs not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?\u201d said Filby, anargumentative person with red hair.\u201cI do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. Youwill soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematicalline, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has amathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.\u201d\u201cThat is all right,\u201d said the Psychologist.\u201cNor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.\u201d\u201cThere I object,\u201d said Filby. \u201cOf course a solid body may exist. All real things\u2014\u201d\u201cSo most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t follow you,\u201d said Filby.\u201cCan a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?\u201dFilby became pensive. \u201cClearly,\u201d the Time Traveller proceeded, \u201cany real body musthave extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and\u2014Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in amoment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, threewhich we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a\n",
    "5": "\u201cI have not,\u201d said the Provincial Mayor.\u201cIt is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as havingthree dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is alwaysdefinable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others. But somephilosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly\u2014why notanother direction at right angles to the other three?\u2014and have even tried to constructa Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to theNew York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flatsurface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions theycould represent one of four\u2014if they could master the perspective of the thing. See?\u201d\u201cI think so,\u201d murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsedinto an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. \u201cYes, Ithink I see it now,\u201d he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\u201cWell, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of FourDimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is aportrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another attwenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensionalrepresentations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\u201cScientific people,\u201d proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required for theproper assimilation of this, \u201cknow very well that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is apopular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows themovement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then thismorning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did not tracethis line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised? But certainly it tracedsuch a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, \u201cif Time is really only afourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded assomething different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the otherdimensions of Space?\u201dThe Time Traveller smiled. \u201cAre you so sure we can move freely in Space? Right andleft we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. Iadmit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation\n",
    "6": "Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we shouldtravel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth\u2019s surface.\u201d\u201cBut the great difficulty is this,\u201d interrupted the Psychologist. \u2019You can move aboutin all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.\u201d\u201cThat is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that we cannotmove about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back tothe instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for amoment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any morethan a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised manis better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in aballoon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop oraccelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the otherway?\u201d\u201cOh, this,\u201d began Filby, \u201cis all\u2014\u201d\u201cWhy not?\u201d said the Time Traveller.\u201cIt\u2019s against reason,\u201d said Filby.\u201cWhat reason?\u201d said the Time Traveller.\u201cYou can show black is white by argument,\u201d said Filby, \u201cbut you will never convinceme.\u201d\u201cPossibly not,\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cBut now you begin to see the object of myinvestigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling ofa machine\u2014\u201d\u201cTo travel through Time!\u201d exclaimed the Very Young Man.\u201cThat shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as the driverdetermines.\u201dFilby contented himself with laughter.\u201cBut I have experimental verification,\u201d said the Time Traveller.\u201cIt would be remarkably convenient for the historian,\u201d the Psychologist suggested.\u201cOne might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, forinstance!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think you would attract attention?\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cOurancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.\u201d\n",
    "7": "\u201cLet\u2019s see your experiment anyhow,\u201d said the Psychologist, \u201cthough it\u2019s all humbug,you know.\u201dThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and with hishands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard hisslippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory.The Psychologist looked at us. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s got?\u201d\u201cSome sleight-of-hand trick or other,\u201d said the Medical Man, and Filby tried to tell usabout a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he had finished his preface theTime Traveller came back, and Filby\u2019s anecdote collapsed. \n",
    "8": "The MachineThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework,scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, andsome transparent crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this thatfollows\u2014unless his explanation is to be accepted\u2014is an absolutely unaccountablething. He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room,and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed themechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the tablewas a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model. There were alsoperhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and severalin sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chairnearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Travellerand the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man andthe Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from theleft. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the alert. Itappears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and howeveradroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. \u201cWell?\u201d said thePsychologist.\u201cThis little affair,\u201d said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the table andpressing his hands together above the apparatus, \u201cis only a model. It is my plan for amachine to travel through time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and thatthere is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some wayunreal.\u201d He pointed to the part with his finger. \u201cAlso, here is one little white lever, andhere is another.\u201dThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing. \u201cIt\u2019s beautifullymade,\u201d he said.\u201cIt took two years to make,\u201d retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we had allimitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: \u201cNow I want you clearly to understandthat this lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and thisother reverses the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently\n",
    "9": "brass and ivory; and it was gone\u2014vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under the table.At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. \u201cWell?\u201d he said, with a reminiscence ofthe Psychologist. Then, getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and withhis back to us began to fill his pipe.We stared at each other. \u201cLook here,\u201d said the Medical Man, \u201care you in earnestabout this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?\u201d\u201cCertainly,\u201d said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the fire. Then heturned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist\u2019s face. (The Psychologist, to showthat he was not unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) \u201cWhatis more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there\u201d\u2014he indicated the laboratory\u2014\u201cand when that is put together I mean to have a journey on my own account.\u201d\u201cYou mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?\u201d said Filby.\u201cInto the future or the past\u2014I don\u2019t, for certain, know which.\u201dAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. \u201cIt must have gone into thepast if it has gone anywhere,\u201d he said.\u201cWhy?\u201d said the Time Traveller.\u201cBecause I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled into the futureit would still be here all this time, since it must have travelled through this time.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d said I, \u201cIf it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we camefirst into this room; and last Thursday when we were here; and the Thursday beforethat; and so forth!\u201d\u201cSerious objections,\u201d remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of impartiality,turning towards the Time Traveller.\u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: \u201cYou think. You canexplain that. It\u2019s presentation below the threshold, you know, diluted presentation.\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d said the Psychologist, and reassured us. \u201cThat\u2019s a simple point ofpsychology. I should have thought of it. It\u2019s plain enough, and helps the paradoxdelightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, any more than wecan the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travellingthrough time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it gets through a\n",
    "10": "incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the littlemechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of nickel, partsof ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing wasgenerally complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the benchbeside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz itseemed to be.\u201cLook here,\u201d said the Medical Man, \u201care you perfectly serious? Or is this a trick\u2014likethat ghost you showed us last Christmas?\u201d\u201cUpon that machine,\u201d said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft, \u201cI intend toexplore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in my life.\u201dNone of us quite knew how to take it.I caught Filby\u2019s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he winked at mesolemnly. \n",
    "11": "The Time Traveller ReturnsI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. The fact is,the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed: you neverfelt that you saw all round him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, someingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model andexplained the matter in the Time Traveller\u2019s words, we should have shown him far lessscepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher couldunderstand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among hiselements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the fame of a lessclever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. Theserious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; theywere somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was likefurnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don\u2019t think any of us said very muchabout time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though itsodd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, itspractical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utterconfusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trickof the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Fridayat the Linn\u00e6an. He said he had seen a similar thing at T\u00fcbingen, and laid considerablestress on the blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could notexplain.The next Thursday I went again to Richmond\u2014I suppose I was one of the TimeTraveller\u2019s most constant guests\u2014and, arriving late, found four or five men alreadyassembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was standing before the fire with asheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other. I looked round for the TimeTraveller, and\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s half-past seven now,\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cI suppose we\u2019d betterhave dinner?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014\u2014?\u201d said I, naming our host.\u201cYou\u2019ve just come? It\u2019s rather odd. He\u2019s unavoidably detained. He asks me in thisnote to lead off with dinner at seven if he\u2019s not back. Says he\u2019ll explain when he comes.\u201d\u201cIt seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,\u201d said the Editor of a well-known daily paper;\n",
    "12": "He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with greendown the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me greyer\u2014either with dustand dirt or because its colour had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin hada brown cut on it\u2014a cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as byintense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzledby the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such a limp as I haveseen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion towards thewine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it towards him. He drained it,and it seemed to do him good: for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his oldsmile flickered across his face. \u201cWhat on earth have you been up to, man?\u201d said theDoctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. \u201cDon\u2019t let me disturb you,\u201d he said,with a certain faltering articulation. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d He stopped, held out his glass formore, and took it off at a draught. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. His eyes grew brighter, and afaint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain dullapproval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again,still as it were feeling his way among his words. \u201cI\u2019m going to wash and dress, and thenI\u2019ll come down and explain things.... Save me some of that mutton. I\u2019m starving for abit of meat.\u201dHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he was all right.The Editor began a question. \u201cTell you presently,\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014funny! Be all right in a minute.\u201dHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I remarked hislameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place, I sawhis feet as he went out. He had nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stainedsocks. Then the door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I rememberedhow he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was wool-gathering. Then, \u201cRemarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,\u201d I heard the Editorsay, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this brought my attention back to thebright dinner-table.\u201cWhat\u2019s the game?\u201d said the Journalist. \u201cHas he been doing the Amateur Cadger? Idon\u2019t follow.\u201d I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my own interpretation in hisface. I thought of the Time Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I don\u2019t think anyoneelse had noticed his lameness.\n",
    "13": "in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kindof journalist\u2014very joyous, irreverent young men. \u201cOur Special Correspondent in theDay after Tomorrow reports,\u201d the Journalist was saying\u2014or rather shouting\u2014whenthe Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, andnothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me.\u201cI say,\u201d said the Editor hilariously, \u201cthese chaps here say you have been travellinginto the middle of next week! Tell us all about little Rosebery, will you? What will youtake for the lot?\u201dThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word. He smiledquietly, in his old way. \u201cWhere\u2019s my mutton?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a treat it is to stick a forkinto meat again!\u201d\u201cStory!\u201d cried the Editor.\u201cStory be damned!\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cI want something to eat. I won\u2019t say aword until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.\u201d\u201cOne word,\u201d said I. \u201cHave you been time travelling?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.\u201cI\u2019d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,\u201d said the Editor. The Time Travellerpushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with his fingernail; at which theSilent Man, who had been staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured himwine. The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questionskept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalisttried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Travellerdevoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp. The MedicalMan smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. TheSilent Man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne withregularity and determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Travellerpushed his plate away, and looked round us. \u201cI suppose I must apologise,\u201d he said. \u201cIwas simply starving. I\u2019ve had a most amazing time.\u201d He reached out his hand for acigar, and cut the end. \u201cBut come into the smoking-room. It\u2019s too long a story to tellover greasy plates.\u201d And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoiningroom.\u201cYou have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?\u201d he said to me,leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.\n",
    "14": "inadequacy\u2014to express its quality. You read, I will suppose, attentively enough; butyou cannot see the speaker\u2019s white, sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp,nor hear the intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed theturns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist and the legs of the SilentMan from the knees downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again ateach other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller\u2019sface. \n",
    "15": "Time Travelling\u201cI told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, andshowed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop. There it is now, a littletravel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but therest of it\u2019s sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when theputting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was exactly oneinch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing was not complete untilthis morning. It was at ten o\u2019clock today that the first of all Time Machines began itscareer. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on thequartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to hisskull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took thestarting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, andalmost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling;and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened?For a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the clock. Amoment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearlyhalf-past three!\u201cI drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and wentoff with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett came in andwalked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her aminute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like arocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turningout of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The laboratory grew faint andhazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow night came black, then day again, nightagain, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and astrange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\u201cI am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They areexcessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback\u2014of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of animminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing.The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I sawthe sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute\n",
    "16": "house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim. I saw trees growingand changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered,and passed away. I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. Thewhole surface of the earth seemed changed\u2014melting and flowing under my eyes. Thelittle hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster.Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in aminute or less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minuteby minute the white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed bythe bright, brief green of spring.\u201cThe unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They merged atlast into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked, indeed, a clumsy swaying of themachine, for which I was unable to account. But my mind was too confused to attendto it, so with a kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first Iscarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. Butpresently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind\u2014a certain curiosity andtherewith a certain dread\u2014until at last they took complete possession of me. Whatstrange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentarycivilisation, I thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dimelusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendidarchitecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, andyet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the hillside,and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even through the veil of myconfusion the earth seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business ofstopping.\u201cThe peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the spacewhich I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled at a high velocity throughtime, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to speak, attenuated\u2014was slipping like a vapourthrough the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved thejamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meantbringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that aprofound chemical reaction\u2014possibly a far-reaching explosion\u2014would result, andblow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions\u2014into the Unknown. Thispossibility had occurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; butthen I had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk\u2014one of the risks a man has got\n",
    "17": "the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin. \u2018Fine hospitality,\u2019 said I, \u2018to aman who has travelled innumerable years to see you.\u2019\u201cPresently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and looked round me. Acolossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond therhododendrons through the hazy downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\u201cMy sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew thinner, Isaw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for a silver birch-tree touchedits shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but thewings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed tohover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick with verdigris. Itchanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; therewas the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and thatimparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space\u2014half a minute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the haildrove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment, and sawthat the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lightening with thepromise of the sun.\u201cI looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity of my voyagecame suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy curtain was altogetherwithdrawn? What might not have happened to men? What if cruelty had grown into acommon passion? What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness, and haddeveloped into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? Imight seem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and disgusting forour common likeness\u2014a foul creature to be incontinently slain.\u201cAlready I saw other vast shapes\u2014huge buildings with intricate parapets and tallcolumns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me through the lesseningstorm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, andstrove hard to readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through thethunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailinggarments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faintbrown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings about me stoodout clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out inwhite by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I felt naked in a strangeworld. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above\n",

His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive\u2014thathectic beauty of which we used to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenlyregained confidence. I took my hands from the machine. \n",

The absence from hisbearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others whowere following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\u201cThere were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten ofthese exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into myhead, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook myhead, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, andthen touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back andshoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at allalarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspiredconfidence\u2014a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked sofrail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins.But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling atthe Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I hadhitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the littlelevers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again tosee what I could do in the way of communication.\u201cAnd then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiaritiesin their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, cameto a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on theface, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red,rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and\u2014this may seem egotism on my part\u2014I fancied even that there was a certain lack of theinterest I might have expected in them.\u201cAs they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round mesmiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation. Ipointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then, hesitating for a moment how toexpress Time, I pointed to the sun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequeredpurple and white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the soundof thunder.\n",

The idea was received with melodious applause; andpresently they were all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging themupon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the likecan scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culturehad created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in thenearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble, which had seemedto watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edificeof fretted stone. As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of aprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible merriment, to mymind.\u201cThe building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal dimensions. I wasnaturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people, and with the big openportals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of theworld I saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, along neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of strange whiteflowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals. They grewscattered, as if wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine themclosely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the turf among therhododendrons.\u201cThe arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not observe thecarving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of old Ph\u0153niciandecorations as I passed through, and it struck me that they were very badly broken andweather-worn. Several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so weentered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough,garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright, soft-colouredrobes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.\u201cThe big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown. Theroof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with coloured glass andpartially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The floor was made up of huge blocks ofsome very hard white metal, not plates nor slabs\u2014blocks, and it was so much worn, asI judged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled alongthe more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made ofslabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from the floor, and upon these were\n",
    "21": "hundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to me as they couldcome, were watching me with interest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they wereeating. All were clad in the same soft, and yet strong, silky material.\u201cFruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote future were strictvegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of some carnal cravings, I had to befrugivorous also. Indeed, I found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, hadfollowed the Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful; one, inparticular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was there\u2014a floury thing in athree-sided husk\u2014was especially good, and I made it my staple. At first I was puzzledby all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began toperceive their import.\u201cHowever, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now. So soon asmy appetite was a little checked, I determined to make a resolute attempt to learn thespeech of these new men of mine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruitsseemed a convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a seriesof interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty in conveyingmy meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishablelaughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention andrepeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business at great length to eachother, and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their languagecaused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement. However, I felt like aschoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and presently I had a score of nounsubstantives at least at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, andeven the verb \u2018to eat.\u2019 But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wantedto get away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity, to let themgive their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I foundthey were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued. \n",
    "22": "The Sunset of Mankind\u201cA queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was their lack ofinterest. They would come to me with eager cries of astonishment, like children, but,like children they would soon stop examining me, and wander away after some othertoy. The dinner and my conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time thatalmost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how speedilyI came to disregard these little people. I went out through the portal into the sunlitworld again as soon as my hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more ofthese men of the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh aboutme, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my owndevices.\u201cThe calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great hall, and thescene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At first things were very confusing.Everything was so entirely different from the world I had known\u2014even the flowers.The big building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but theThames had shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to mount tothe summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from which I could get a widerview of this our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundredand One, A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little dials of my machinerecorded.\u201cAs I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly help toexplain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the world\u2014for ruinous itwas. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a great heap of granite, bound togetherby masses of aluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps,amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants\u2014nettles possibly\u2014but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of stinging. Itwas evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure, to what end built I could notdetermine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have a very strangeexperience\u2014the first intimation of a still stranger discovery\u2014but of that I will speak inits proper place.\u201cLooking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested for awhile, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen. Apparently the single\n",
    "23": "physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion.\u201cSeeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt that this closeresemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect; for the strength of a manand the softness of a woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation ofoccupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Wherepopulation is balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather thana blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure, thereis less necessity\u2014indeed there is no necessity\u2014for an efficient family, and thespecialisation of the sexes with reference to their children\u2019s needs disappears. We seesome beginnings of this even in our own time, and in this future age it was complete.This, I must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciatehow far it fell short of the reality.\u201cWhile I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a prettylittle structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a transitory way of the oddnessof wells still existing, and then resumed the thread of my speculations. There were nolarge buildings towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidentlymiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a strange sense offreedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\u201cThere I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognise, corroded inplaces with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss, the arm-rests castand filed into the resemblance of griffins\u2019 heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed thebroad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and faira view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon and the westwas flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson. Belowwas the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. Ihave already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery,some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure inthe waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of somecupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences ofagriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.\u201cSo watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had seen, and as itshaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was something in this way.(Afterwards I found I had got only a half truth\u2014or only a glimpse of one facet of thetruth.)\n",
    "24": "Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivateperhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out abalance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and animals\u2014and how few theyare\u2014gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedlessgrape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. Weimprove them gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and ourknowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands.Some day all this will be better organised, and still better. That is the drift of thecurrent in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In theend, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life tosuit our human needs.\u201cThis adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done indeed for allTime, in the space of Time across which my machine had leapt. The air was free fromgnats, the earth from weeds or fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightfulflowers; brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicinewas attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any contagiousdiseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you later that even the processes ofputrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.\u201cSocial triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in splendidshelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them engaged in no toil. There wereno signs of struggle, neither social nor economical struggle. The shop, theadvertisement, traffic, all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world, wasgone. It was natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a socialparadise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met, I guessed, andpopulation had ceased to increase.\u201cBut with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change.What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the cause of human intelligenceand vigour? Hardship and freedom: conditions under which the active, strong, andsubtle survive and the weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon theloyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision. And theinstitution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein, the fierce jealousy, thetenderness for offspring, parental self-devotion, all found their justification andsupport in the imminent dangers of the young.

And in a state of physical balance and security, power,intellectual as well as physical, would be out of place. For countless years I judged therehad been no danger of war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wastingdisease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life, what weshould call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak.Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for whichthere was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was theoutcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before itsettled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived\u2014theflourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has ever been the fateof energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor and decay.\u201cEven this artistic impetus would at last die away\u2014had almost died in the Time Isaw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the sunlight: so much wasleft of the artistic spirit, and no more. Even that would fade in the end into a contentedinactivity.

Very simple was my explanation, andplausible enough\u2014as most wrong theories are! \n",
    "26": "A Sudden Shock\u201cAs I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full moon,yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north-east. Thebright little figures ceased to move about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and Ishivered with the chill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I couldsleep.\u201cI looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the figure of theWhite Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing distinct as the light of the risingmoon grew brighter. I could see the silver birch against it. There was the tangle ofrhododendron bushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked atthe lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. \u2018No,\u2019 said I stoutly to myself,\u2018that was not the lawn.\u2019\u201cBut it was the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it. Canyou imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to me? But you cannot. The TimeMachine was gone!\u201cAt once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing my own age, ofbeing left helpless in this strange new world. The bare thought of it was an actualphysical sensation. I could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. Inanother moment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping stridesdown the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching theblood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All thetime I ran I was saying to myself: \u2018They have moved it a little, pushed it under thebushes out of the way.\u2019 Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the time, with thecertainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance wasfolly, knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breathcame with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the littlelawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. I cursed aloud, asI ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. Icried aloud, and none answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlitworld.\u201cWhen I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace of the thing was\n",
    "27": "\u201cI think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently in and outamong the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling some white animal that,in the dim light, I took for a small deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating thebushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from thebroken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to thegreat building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on theuneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit amatch and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.\u201cThere I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which, perhaps, ascore or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no doubt they found my secondappearance strange enough, coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness withinarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten aboutmatches. \u2018Where is my Time Machine?\u2019 I began, bawling like an angry child, layinghands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer tothem. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw themstanding round me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it waspossible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must be forgotten.\u201cAbruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people over in mycourse, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out under the moonlight. Iheard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that. I donot remember all I did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpectednature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind\u2014astrange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro, screaming andcrying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible fatigue, as the long night ofdespair wore away; of looking in this impossible place and that; of groping amongmoonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying onthe ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger atthe folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. I had nothingleft but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple ofsparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm.\u201cI sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had got there,and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and despair. Then things came clearin my mind. With the plain, reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly\n",

I had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their prettylaughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind angerwas ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity. The turf gave bettercounsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal of thesphinx and the marks of my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturnedmachine. There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints likethose I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer attention to thepedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highlydecorated with deep framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. Thepedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous withthe frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they weredoors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. Ittook no very great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside thatpedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.\u201cI saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and undersome blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling to them, andbeckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried tointimate my wish to open it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved veryoddly. I don\u2019t know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use agrossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman\u2014it is how she would look. Theywent off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking littlechap in white next, with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feelashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him oncemore. As he turned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three stridesI was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck, and begandragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his face,and all of a sudden I let him go.\u201cBut I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels. I thought Iheard something stir inside\u2014to be explicit, I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle\u2014but I must have been mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came andhammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off inpowdery flakes.

Although it was at my own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.\u201cGoing through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people avoided me. Itmay have been my fancy, or it may have had something to do with my hammering atthe gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, toshow no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day ortwo things got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the language,and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there. Either I missed some subtlepoint or their language was excessively simple\u2014almost exclusively composed ofconcrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, orlittle use of figurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two words,and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined toput the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under thesphinx, as much as possible in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledgewould lead me back to them in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you mayunderstand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival. \n",
    "30": "Explanation\u201cSo far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as theThames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same abundance of splendidbuildings, endlessly varied in material and style, the same clustering thickets ofevergreens, the same blossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shonelike silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so faded into theserenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently attracted my attention, was thepresence of certain circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. Onelay by the path up the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others, itwas rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola from therain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness, Icould see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection with a lighted match. Butin all of them I heard a certain sound: a thud\u2014thud\u2014thud, like the beating of some bigengine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of airset down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one, and,instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight.\u201cAfter a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here andthere upon the slopes; for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air asone sees on a hot day above a sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached astrong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose trueimport it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to associate it with thesanitary apparatus of these people. It was an obvious conclusion, but it was absolutelywrong.\u201cAnd here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells and modes ofconveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in this real future. In some ofthese visions of Utopias and coming times which I have read, there is a vast amount ofdetail about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while such details areeasy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one\u2019s imagination, theyare altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as I found here.Conceive the tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take backto his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of social movements, oftelephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders and\n",
    "31": "which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among this people there were none.\u201cI must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automaticcivilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet I could think of no other.Let me put my difficulties. The several big palaces I had explored were mere livingplaces, great dining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, noappliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must attimes need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly complexspecimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And the little peopledisplayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, nosign of importations among them. They spent all their time in playing gently, inbathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit andsleeping. I could not see how things were kept going.\u201cThen, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had taken itinto the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For the life of me I could notimagine. Those waterless wells, too, those flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt\u2014how shall I put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there inexcellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of words, of letterseven, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third day of my visit, that was how theworld of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself tome!\u201cThat day, too, I made a friend\u2014of a sort. It happened that, as I was watching someof the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was seized with cramp and begandrifting downstream. The main current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly foreven a moderate swimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiencyin these creatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue theweakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. When I realised this, Ihurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I caught thepoor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought herround, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got tosuch a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her. In that,however, I was wrong.\u201cThis happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman, as I believeit was, as I was returning towards my centre from an exploration, and she received mewith cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers\u2014evidently made\n",

Yet her distress when I left her was very great,her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I hadas much trouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a verygreat comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Untilit was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Noruntil it was too late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merelyseeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she cared for me, thelittle doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the WhiteSphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure ofwhite and gold so soon as I came over the hill.\u201cIt was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the world. She wasfearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest confidence in me; for once, in afoolish moment, I made threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them.But she dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her wasthe one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set me thinkingand observing. I discovered then, among other things, that these little people gatheredinto the great houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without alight was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, orone sleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a blockhead that Imissed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of Weena\u2019s distress, I insisted upon sleepingaway from these slumbering multitudes.\u201cIt troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed, and forfive of the nights of our acquaintance, including the last night of all, she slept with herhead pillowed on my arm. But my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It musthave been the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had beenrestless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea anemones werefeeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a start, and with an odd fancythat some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleepagain, but I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things arejust creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut, and yetunreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones infront of the palace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.\u201cThe moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn weremingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black, the ground a sombre grey,\n",

But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking ofthese figures all the morning, until Weena\u2019s rescue drove them out of my head. Iassociated them in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in myfirst passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yetall the same, they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.\u201cI think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this GoldenAge. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was hotter, or the earth nearer thesun. It is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. Butpeople, unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget thatthe planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As thesecatastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and it may be that someinner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the sunwas very much hotter than we know it.\u201cWell, one very hot morning\u2014my fourth, I think\u2014as I was seeking shelter from theheat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I slept and fed, therehappened this strange thing. Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found anarrow gallery, whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. Ientered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swimbefore me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection againstthe daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.\u201cThe old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my hands andsteadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to turn. Then the thought ofthe absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind. Andthen I remembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to someextent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once the eyes dartedsideways, and something white ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, andsaw a queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar manner, runningacross the sunlit space behind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggeredaside, and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruinedmasonry.\u201cMy impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull white, and had\n",
    "34": "\u201cI do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for some time thatI could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I had seen was human. But,gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man had not remained one species, but haddifferentiated into two distinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper Worldwere not the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene,nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the ages.\u201cI thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation.I began to suspect their true import. And what, I wondered, was this Lemur doing inmy scheme of a perfectly balanced organisation? How was it related to the indolentserenity of the beautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the footof that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any rate, there wasnothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the solution of my difficulties. Andwithal I was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworldpeople came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. Themale pursued the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.\u201cThey seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned pillar, peeringdown the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures; forwhen I pointed to this one, and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue, theywere still more visibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by mymatches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, andagain I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena, and see what Icould get from her. But my mind was already in revolution; my guesses andimpressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to theimport of these wells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to saynothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time Machine!And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economicproblem that had puzzled me.\u201cHere was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was subterranean.There were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rareemergence above ground was the outcome of a long-continued underground habit. Inthe first place, there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largelyin the dark\u2014the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of nocturnal things\u2014witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that\n",
    "35": "\u201cAt first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear as daylightto me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social differencebetween the Capitalist and the Labourer was the key to the whole position. No doubt itwill seem grotesque enough to you\u2014and wildly incredible!\u2014and yet even now thereare existing circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to utiliseunderground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation; there is theMetropolitan Railway in London, for instance, there are new electric railways, there aresubways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase andmultiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had graduallylost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger andever larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of its timetherein, till, in the end\u2014! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificialconditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth?\u201cAgain, the exclusive tendency of richer people\u2014due, no doubt, to the increasingrefinement of their education, and the widening gulf between them and the rudeviolence of the poor\u2014is already leading to the closing, in their interest, of considerableportions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half theprettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf\u2014which isdue to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increasedfacilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich\u2014will makethat exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage which atpresent retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification, less andless frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasureand comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers gettingcontinually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they were there, theywould no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of theircaverns; and if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such ofthem as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in theend, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted to theconditions of underground life, and as happy in their way, as the Overworld peoplewere to theirs. As it seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followednaturally enough.\u201cThe great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape in mymind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general co-operation as I\n",
    "36": "I already knew.\u201cThen came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time Machine?For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the Eloi were masters, couldthey not restore the machine to me? And why were they so terribly afraid of the dark? Iproceeded, as I have said, to question Weena about this Underworld, but here again Iwas disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and presently sherefused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic was unendurable. And whenI pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears,except my own, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly totrouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of herhuman inheritance from Weena\u2019s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and clappingher hands, while I solemnly burnt a match. \n",
    "37": "The Morlocks\u201cIt may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a peculiar shrinking fromthose pallid bodies. They were just the half-bleached colour of the worms and thingsone sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to thetouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi,whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate.\u201cThe next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little disordered. Iwas oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I had a feeling of intense fearfor which I could perceive no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into thegreat hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight\u2014that night Weenawas among them\u2014and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me eventhen, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter, andthe nights grow dark, when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below,these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be moreabundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks aninevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered byboldly penetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the mystery. Ifonly I had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so horribly alone,and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me. I don\u2019t know ifyou will understand my feeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.\u201cIt was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me farther and fartherafield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the south-westward towards the risingcountry that is now called Combe Wood, I observed far-off, in the direction ofnineteenth-century Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any Ihad hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and thefa\u00e7ade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-greentint, a kind of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference inaspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But theday was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiringcircuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I returned tothe welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly\n",
    "38": "over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstablehooks to which I clung.\u201cI had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The descent waseffected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well, and thesebeing adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I wasspeedily cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of thebars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blacknessbeneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I did not dare torest again. Though my arms and back were presently acutely painful, I went onclambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancingupward, I saw the aperture, a small blue disc, in which a star was visible, while littleWeena\u2019s head showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machinebelow grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disc above wasprofoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had disappeared.\u201cI was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up the shaftagain, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I turned this over in my mind Icontinued to descend. At last, with intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to theright of me, a slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was theaperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and rest. It was nottoo soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I was trembling with theprolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness had had a distressingeffect upon my eyes. The air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping airdown the shaft.\u201cI do not know how long I lay. I was arroused by a soft hand touching my face.Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and, hastily striking one, I sawthree stooping white creatures similar to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin,hastily retreating before the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to meimpenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are thepupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the same way. I have nodoubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have anyfear of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in order to see them,they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which theireyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.\u201cI tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently different from\n",
    "39": "carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large animal could havesurvived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, thebig unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and only waitingfor the darkness to come at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung myfingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.\u201cI have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an experience.When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with the absurd assumptionthat the men of the Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all theirappliances. I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke\u2014at times I missed tobacco frightfully!\u2014even without enough matches. If only I hadthought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld in a second,and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and thepowers that Nature had endowed me with\u2014hands, feet, and teeth; these, and foursafety-matches that still remained to me.\u201cI was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark, and it wasonly with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store of matches had run low. Ithad never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economisethem, and I had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whomfire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a handtouched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiarunpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful littlebeings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, andother hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creaturesexamining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my ignoranceof their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. Ishouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then I could feel themapproaching me again. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds toeach other. I shivered violently, and shouted again\u2014rather discordantly. This timethey were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as theycame back at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined to strikeanother match and escape under the protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out theflicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrowtunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blacknessI could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves, and pattering like the rain,\n",
    "40": "all but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my bootas a trophy.\u201cThat climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty feet of it adeadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. The lastfew yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam,and I felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouthsomehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face.Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember Weena kissing my hands andears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible. \n",
    "41": "When Night Came\u201cNow, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except during mynight\u2019s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimateescape, but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merelythought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and by someunknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was analtogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks\u2014a somethinginhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man mightfeel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.\u201cThe enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new moon.Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about theDark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the comingDark Nights might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longerinterval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at least the reason ofthe fear of the little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foulvillainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure nowthat my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld people might once havebeen the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but thathad long since passed away. The two species that had resulted from the evolution ofman were sliding down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether newrelationship. The Eloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautifulfutility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterraneanfor innumerable generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable.And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in theirhabitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as astanding horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: becauseancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the oldorder was already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping onapace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out ofthe ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back\u2014changed! Alreadythe Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were becoming reacquainted\n",
    "42": "shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me.\u201cI wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but foundnothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the buildings and treesseemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by theirwells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polishedgleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena like achild upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the south-west. The distance, Ihad reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I hadfirst seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. Inaddition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through thesole\u2014they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors\u2014so that I was lame. And itwas already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted blackagainst the pale yellow of the sky.\u201cWeena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a while shedesired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me, occasionally darting off oneither hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzledWeena, but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases forfloral decoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that reminds me! Inchanging my jacket I found\u2026\u201dThe Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed twowithered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table. Then heresumed his narrative.\u201cAs the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill cresttowards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of greystone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her,and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from herFear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even thebreeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that eveningstillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far downin the sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my fears. In thatdarkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feelthe hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it theMorlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark. In myexcitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a\n",
    "43": "me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to the right or the left. Feelingtired\u2014my feet, in particular, were very sore\u2014I carefully lowered Weena from myshoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace ofGreen Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the thickness of thewood and thought of what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches onewould be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking danger\u2014a danger Idid not care to let my imagination loose upon\u2014there would still be all the roots tostumble over and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after theexcitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but would pass the nightupon the open hill.\u201cWeena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in my jacket,and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The hillside was quiet and deserted,but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things. Aboveme shone the stars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendlycomfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however:that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had longsince rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me,was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it)was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more splendid than our owngreen Sirius. And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shonekindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.\u201cLooking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities ofterrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the slow inevitable driftof their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future. I thought ofthe great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty times hadthat silent revolution occurred during all the years that I had traversed. And duringthese few revolutions all the activity, all the traditions, the complex organisations, thenations, languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knewhim, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who hadforgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went in terror. Then Ithought of the Great Fear that was between the two species, and for the first time, witha sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet itwas too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white andstarlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought.\n",
    "44": "soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing in the sunlight as thoughthere was no such thing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of themeat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of myheart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly, at some timein the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks\u2019 food had run short. Possibly they hadlived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating andexclusive in his food than he was\u2014far less than any monkey. His prejudice againsthuman flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men\u2014\u2014! I triedto look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and moreremote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. And theintelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone. Why shouldI trouble myself? These Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlockspreserved and preyed upon\u2014probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weenadancing at my side!\u201cThen I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me, byregarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man had been content tolive in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as hiswatchword and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. Ieven tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this attitude ofmind was impossible. However great their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kepttoo much of the human form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce asharer in their degradation and their Fear.\u201cI had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My first was tosecure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as Icould contrive. That necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procuresome means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, Iknew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to arrange somecontrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind abattering ram. I had a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze oflight before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine theMorlocks were strong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring withme to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our waytowards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.\n",
    "45": "The Palace of Green Porcelain\u201cI found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about noon, desertedand falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and greatsheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. Itlay very high upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I wassurprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged Wandsworth andBattersea must once have been. I thought then\u2014though I never followed up thethought\u2014of what might have happened, or might be happening, to the living things inthe sea.\u201cThe material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, andalong the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown character. I thought, ratherfoolishly, that Weena might help me to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bareidea of writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, morehuman than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.\u201cWithin the big valves of the door\u2014which were open and broken\u2014we found,instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows. At the firstglance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was thick with dust, and aremarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering.Then I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearlythe lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was someextinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper boneslay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had dropped througha leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was thehuge skeleton barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Goingtowards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away thethick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they must havebeen air-tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents.\u201cClearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington! Here,apparently, was the Pal\u00e6ontological Section, and a very splendid array of fossils itmust have been, though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for atime, and had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-ninehundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme\n",
    "46": "interesting than this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found anothershort gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals,and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I couldfind no saltpetre; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced agesago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the rest ofthe contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved of all Isaw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on down a veryruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this sectionhad been devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out ofrecognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffedanimals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a brown dust ofdeparted plants: that was all! I was sorry for that, because I should have been glad totrace the patient readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had beenattained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which I entered.At intervals white globes hung from the ceiling\u2014many of them cracked and smashed\u2014which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more inmy element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines, allgreatly corroded and many broken down, but some still fairly complete. You know Ihave a certain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; themore so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only thevaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their puzzles Ishould find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the Morlocks.\u201cSuddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she startled me. Hadit not been for her I do not think I should have noticed that the floor of the gallerysloped at all. [Footnote: It may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that themuseum was built into the side of a hill.\u2014ED.] The end I had come in at was quiteabove ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down the length, theground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit like the \u2018area\u2018 of aLondon house before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowlyalong, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice thegradual diminution of the light, until Weena\u2019s increasing apprehensions drew myattention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. Ihesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant and itssurface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a\n",
    "47": "Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Veryinhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one\u2019s own descendants! But it wasimpossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my disinclination toleave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my TimeMachine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killingthe brutes I heard.\u201cWell, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that gallery and intoanother and still larger one, which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapelhung with tattered flags. The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, Ipresently recognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped topieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here and there were warpedboards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literaryman I might, perhaps, have moralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was,the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour towhich this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I will confess that Ithought chiefly of the Philosophical Transactions and my own seventeen papers uponphysical optics.\u201cThen, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery oftechnical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of useful discoveries. Except at oneend where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly toevery unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box ofmatches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not evendamp. I turned to Weena. \u2018Dance,\u2019 I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had aweapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelictmuseum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena\u2019s huge delight, I solemnlyperformed a kind of composite dance, whistling The Land of the Leal as cheerfully as Icould. In part it was a modest cancan, in part a step dance, in part a skirt dance (so faras my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive, as youknow.\u201cNow, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time forimmemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was a most fortunate, thing. Yet,oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in asealed jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied atfirst that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of\n",

One corner I sawwas charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens.In another place was a vast array of idols\u2014Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Ph\u0153nician,every country on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, Iwrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America thatparticularly took my fancy.\u201cAs the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery after gallery,dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite,sometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine,and then by the merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamitecartridges! I shouted \u2018Eureka!\u2019 and smashed the case with joy. Then came a doubt. Ihesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. I never felt such adisappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion thatnever came. Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from theirpresence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed offincontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my chances offinding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence.\u201cIt was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within the palace. Itwas turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and refreshed ourselves. Towardssunset I began to consider our position. Night was creeping upon us, and myinaccessible hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little now. Ihad in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against theMorlocks\u2014I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed.It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towardsthat, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt verydifferently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never impressed me asbeing very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for thework. \n",
    "49": "In the Darkness\u201cWe emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon. Iwas determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere the dusk Ipurposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey.My plan was to go as far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in theprotection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or driedgrass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progresswas slower than I had anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began tosuffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood. Uponthe shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the darkness before us;but a singular sense of impending calamity, that should indeed have served me as awarning, drove me onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and Iwas feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.\u201cWhile we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against theirblackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and long grass all about us,and I did not feel safe from their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, wasrather less than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as itseemed to me, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my matchesand my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yetit was evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should have toabandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into myhead that I would amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover theatrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move forcovering our retreat.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in theabsence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun\u2019s heat is rarely strong enough toburn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropicaldistricts. Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire.Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation, butthis rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had beenforgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were analtogether new and strange thing to Weena.\n",
    "50": "rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of the blood-vessels inmy ears. Then I seemed to know of a pattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. Thepattering grew more distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I hadheard in the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and they wereclosing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at my coat, then somethingat my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and became quite still.\u201cIt was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so, and, as Ifumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness about my knees, perfectlysilent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Softlittle hands, too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck. Thenthe match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of theMorlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket,and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. Shewas lying clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground. With asudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block ofcamphor and flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back theMorlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full ofthe stir and murmur of a great company!\u201cShe seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to pushon, and then there came a horrible realisation. In man\u0153uvring with my matches andWeena, I had turned myself about several times, and now I had not the faintest idea inwhat direction lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace ofGreen Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly what to do. Idetermined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I put Weena, still motionless,down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I begancollecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks\u2019eyes shone like carbuncles.\u201cThe camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so, two white formsthat had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away. One was so blinded by thelight that he came straight for me, and I felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist.He gave a whoop of dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece ofcamphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was some ofthe foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, norain had fallen. So, instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began\n",
    "51": "by the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in thedarkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in a monstrousspider\u2019s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. Irolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. Istruggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short, I thrustwhere I judged their faces might be. I could feel the succulent giving of flesh and boneunder my blows, and for a moment I was free.\u201cThe strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came uponme. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined to make the Morlockspay for their meat. I stood with my back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. Thewhole wood was full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voicesseemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yetnone came within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope.What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing.The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the Morlocks aboutme\u2014three battered at my feet\u2014and then I recognised, with incredulous surprise, thatthe others were running, in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, andaway through the wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between thebranches, and vanish. And at that I understood the smell of burning wood, theslumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and theMorlocks\u2019 flight.\u201cStepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the blackpillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was my first fire comingafter me. With that I looked for Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and cracklingbehind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time forreflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks\u2019 path. It was a close race.Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked andhad to strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I didso, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into thefire!\u201cAnd now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of all that I beheldin that future age. This whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire.In the centre was a hillock or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond\n",
    "52": "the fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill amongthem and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was gone.\u201cAt last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strangeincredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making uncanny noises toeach other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamedacross the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though theybelonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks cameblundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did so.\u201cFor the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I bit myselfand screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the ground with my hands, andgot up and sat down again, and wandered here and there, and again sat down. Then Iwould fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I sawMorlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last,above the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke and thewhitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dimcreatures, came the white light of the day.\u201cI searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was plain that theyhad left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot describe how it relieved me to thinkthat it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, Iwas almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but Icontained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in the forest. From itssummit I could now make out through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain,and from that I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving theremnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the daygrew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes andamong black stems that still pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place ofthe Time Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and Ifelt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed anoverwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of adream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely again\u2014terriblyalone. I began to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and withsuch thoughts came a longing that was pain.\u201cBut, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky, I made adiscovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches. The box must have\n",
    "53": "The Trap of the White Sphinx\u201cAbout eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow metal fromwhich I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival. I thought of my hastyconclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at myconfidence. Here was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the samesplendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between itsfertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither amongthe trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and thatsuddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose thecupolas above the ways to the Underworld. I understood now what all the beauty ofthe Overworld people covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day ofthe cattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against noneeds. And their end was the same.\u201cI grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been. It hadcommitted suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease, a balancedsociety with security and permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes\u2014tocome to this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety.The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life andwork. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no socialquestion left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.\u201cIt is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensationfor change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environmentis a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinctare useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change.Only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needsand dangers.\u201cSo, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness, andthe Underworld to mere mechanical industry. But that perfect state had lacked onething even for mechanical perfection\u2014absolute permanency. Apparently as time wenton, the feeding of an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed.Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years, came back again,and she began below. The Underworld being in contact with machinery, which,\n",
    "54": "the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down the hill towards the WhiteSphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and the other hand played with the matches inmy pocket.\u201cAnd now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of thesphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into grooves.\u201cAt that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\u201cWithin was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of this was theTime Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So here, after all my elaboratepreparations for the siege of the White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my ironbar away, almost sorry not to use it.\u201cA sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal. For once, atleast, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks. Suppressing a strong inclinationto laugh, I stepped through the bronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I wassurprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that theMorlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp itspurpose.\u201cNow as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch of thecontrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze panels suddenly slid upand struck the frame with a clang. I was in the dark\u2014trapped. So the Morlocksthought. At that I chuckled gleefully.\u201cI could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me. Verycalmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the levers and depart then like aghost. But I had overlooked one little thing. The matches were of that abominable kindthat light only on the box.\u201cYou may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close upon me.One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers, andbegan to scramble into the saddle of the machine. Then came one hand upon me andthen another. Then I had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers,and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, theyalmost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark withmy head\u2014I could hear the Morlock\u2019s skull ring\u2014to recover it. It was a nearer thingthan the fight in the forest, I think, this last scramble.\u201cBut at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands slipped from\n",
    "55": "The Further Vision\u201cI have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with timetravelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sideways and inan unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung to the machine as it swayed andvibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dialsagain I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records days, and anotherthousands of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions. Now,instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them,and when I came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand wassweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch\u2014into futurity.\u201cAs I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things. Thepalpitating greyness grew darker; then\u2014though I was still travelling with prodigiousvelocity\u2014the blinking succession of day and night, which was usually indicative of aslower pace, returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much atfirst. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the passageof the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through centuries. At last asteady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when acomet glared across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the sun hadlong since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set\u2014it simply rose and fell in thewest, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had vanished. Thecircling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points oflight. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionlessupon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering amomentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantlyagain, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this slowing down ofits rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come torest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Verycautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse my motion.Slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionlessand the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dimoutlines of a desolate beach grew visible.\u201cI stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round. The sky was\n",
    "56": "and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thickincrustation of salt\u2014pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in myhead, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me of myonly experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefiedthan it is now.\u201cFar away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing like a hugewhite butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and, circling, disappear oversome low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered andseated myself more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towardsme. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you imagine acrab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its bigclaws swaying, its long antenn\u00e6, like carters\u2019 whips, waving and feeling, and itsstalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front? Its back wascorrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustationblotched it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouthflickering and feeling as it moved.\u201cAs I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a tickling on mycheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to brush it away with my hand, but in amoment it returned, and almost immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this,and caught something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With afrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of another monstercrab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks, its mouthwas all alive with appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,were descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed amonth between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach, and Isaw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawlinghere and there, in the sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.\u201cI cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world. Thered eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea, the stony beach crawlingwith these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of thelichenous plants, the thin air that hurts one\u2019s lungs: all contributed to an appallingeffect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same red sun\u2014a little larger, alittle duller\u2014the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same crowd of earthy\n",
    "57": "ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.\u201cI looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A certain indefinableapprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine. But I saw nothing moving, inearth or sky or sea. The green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was notextinct. A shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded fromthe beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but itbecame motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye had been deceived, andthat the black object was merely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright andseemed to me to twinkle very little.\u201cSuddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed; thata concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this grow larger. For a minuteperhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day, and then Irealised that an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury waspassing across the sun\u2019s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there ismuch to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner planetpassing very near to the earth.\u201cThe darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from theeast, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number. From the edge ofthe sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent.Silent? It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleatingof sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background ofour lives\u2014all that was over. As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew moreabundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At last, one byone, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished intoblackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of theeclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. Allelse was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.\u201cA horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my marrow,and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and a deadly nausea seizedme. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off themachine to recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As Istood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal\u2014there was nomistake now that it was a moving thing\u2014against the red water of the sea. It was around thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles trailed\n",
    "58": "The Time Traveller\u2019s Return\u201cSo I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the machine. Theblinking succession of the days and nights was resumed, the sun got golden again, thesky blue. I breathed with greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbedand flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dimshadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed andpassed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero, I slackenedspeed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousandshand ran back to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower. Thenthe old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently, now, I slowed themechanism down.\u201cI saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you that when I setout, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett had walked across the room,travelling, as it seemed to me, like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across thatminute when she traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to bethe exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened, and sheglided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and disappeared behind the door bywhich she had previously entered. Just before that I seemed to see Hillyer for amoment; but he passed like a flash.\u201cThen I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory,my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off the thing very shakily, and satdown upon my bench. For several minutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer.Around me was my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have sleptthere, and the whole thing have been a dream.\u201cAnd yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner of thelaboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against the wall where you sawit. That gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the WhiteSphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.\u201cFor a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through thepassage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. Isaw the Pall Mall Gazette on the table by the door. I found the date was indeed today,\n",
    "59": "After the Story\u201cI know,\u201d he said, after a pause, \u201cthat all this will be absolutely incredible to you,but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here tonight in this old familiar roomlooking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures.\u201d He looked atthe Medical Man. \u201cNo. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie\u2014or a prophecy.Say I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destiniesof our race, until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its truth as a merestroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?\u201dHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap with itnervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary stillness. Then chairsbegan to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet. I took my eyes off the TimeTraveller\u2019s face, and looked round at his audience. They were in the dark, and littlespots of colour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in thecontemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar\u2014thesixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I remember, weremotionless.The Editor stood up with a sigh. \u201cWhat a pity it is you\u2019re not a writer of stories!\u201d hesaid, putting his hand on the Time Traveller\u2019s shoulder.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it?\u201d\u201cWell\u2014\u2014\u201d\u201cI thought not.\u201dThe Time Traveller turned to us. \u201cWhere are the matches?\u201d he said. He lit one andspoke over his pipe, puffing. \u201cTo tell you the truth... I hardly believe it myself..... Andyet...\u201dHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the littletable. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I saw he was looking at somehalf-healed scars on his knuckles.The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. \u201cThegyn\u00e6ceum\u2019s odd,\u201d he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see, holding out his handfor a specimen.\n",
    "60": "life is a dream, a precious poor dream at times\u2014but I can\u2019t stand another that won\u2019t fit.It\u2019s madness. And where did the dream come from? \u2026 I must look at that machine. Ifthere is one!\u201dHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the door into thecorridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light of the lamp was the machinesure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucentglimmering quartz. Solid to the touch\u2014for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it\u2014and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon thelower parts, and one rail bent awry.The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand along thedamaged rail. \u201cIt\u2019s all right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story I told you was true. I\u2019m sorry tohave brought you out here in the cold.\u201d He took up the lamp, and, in an absolutesilence, we returned to the smoking-room.He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat. The MedicalMan looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told him he was suffering fromoverwork, at which he laughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway,bawling good-night.I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a \u201cgaudy lie.\u201d For my own part Iwas unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so fantastic and incredible, thetelling so credible and sober. I lay awake most of the night thinking about it. Idetermined to go next day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in thelaboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put out my handand touched the lever. At that the squat substantial-looking mass swayed like a boughshaken by the wind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queerreminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came backthrough the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He was comingfrom the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other.He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. \u201cI\u2019m frightfully busy,\u201dsaid he, \u201cwith that thing in there.\u201d\u201cBut is it not some hoax?\u201d I said. \u201cDo you really travel through time?\u201d\u201cReally and truly I do.\u201d And he looked frankly into my eyes. He hesitated. His eyewandered about the room. \u201cI only want half an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cI know why you came,and it\u2019s awfully good of you. There\u2019s some magazines here. If you\u2019ll stop to lunch I\u2019ll\n",
    "61": "mass of black and brass for a moment\u2014a figure so transparent that the bench behindwith its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as Irubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, thefurther end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had, apparently, justbeen blown in.I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had happened,and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be. As I stoodstaring, the door into the garden opened, and the man-servant appeared.We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. \u201cHas Mr. \u2014\u2014 gone out thatway?\u201d said I.\u201cNo, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him here.\u201dAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed on, waitingfor the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still stranger story, and thespecimens and photographs he would bring with him. But I am beginning now to fearthat I must wait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, aseverybody knows now, he has never returned. \n",
    "62": "EpilogueOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he swept backinto the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age ofUnpolished Stone; into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesquesaurians, the huge reptilian brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now\u2014if I mayuse the phrase\u2014be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, orbeside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward, into one of thenearer ages, in which men are still men, but with the riddles of our own time answeredand its wearisome problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my ownpart, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory, andmutual discord are indeed man\u2019s culminating time! I say, for my own part. He, I know\u2014for the question had been discussed among us long before the Time Machine wasmade\u2014thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in thegrowing pile of civilisation only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back uponand destroy its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as though itwere not so. But to me the future is still black and blank\u2014is a vast ignorance, lit at afew casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for my comfort, twostrange white flowers\u2014shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle\u2014to witnessthat even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness stilllived on in the heart of man. \n"
