    "4": "Introduction\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a\nrecondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face\nwas flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the\nincandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in\nour glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than\nsubmitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when\nthought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this\nway\u2014marking the points with a lean forefinger\u2014as we sat and lazily admired his\nearnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.\n\u201cYou must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are\nalmost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is\nfounded on a misconception.\u201d\n\u201cIs not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?\u201d said Filby, an\nargumentative person with red hair.\n\u201cI do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You\nwill soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical\nline, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a\nmathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.\u201d\n\u201cThat is all right,\u201d said the Psychologist.\n\u201cNor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.\u201d\n\u201cThere I object,\u201d said Filby. \u201cOf course a solid body may exist. All real things\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t follow you,\u201d said Filby.\n\u201cCan a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?\u201d\nFilby became pensive. \u201cClearly,\u201d the Time Traveller proceeded, \u201cany real body must\nhave extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and\u2014\nDuration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a\nmoment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three\nwhich we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a\ntendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the\nlatter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one\ndirection along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over\nthe lamp; \u201cthat . . . very clear indeed.\u201d\n\u201cNow, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,\u201d continued the\nTime Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. \u201cReally this is what is meant by\nthe Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do\nnot know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference\nbetween Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness\nmoves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You\nhave all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?\u201d\n",
    "5": "\u201cI have not,\u201d said the Provincial Mayor.\n\u201cIt is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having\nthree dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always\ndefinable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some\nphilosophical people have been asking why three dimensions particularly\u2014why not\nanother direction at right angles to the other three?\u2014and have even tried to construct\na Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the\nNew York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat\nsurface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-\ndimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they\ncould represent one of four\u2014if they could master the perspective of the thing. See?\u201d\n\u201cI think so,\u201d murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed\ninto an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. \u201cYes, I\nthink I see it now,\u201d he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n\u201cWell, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four\nDimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a\nportrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at\ntwenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional\nrepresentations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\n\u201cScientific people,\u201d proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required for the\nproper assimilation of this, \u201cknow very well that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a\npopular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the\nmovement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this\nmorning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did not trace\nthis line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised? But certainly it traced\nsuch a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-\nDimension.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, \u201cif Time is really only a\nfourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as\nsomething different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other\ndimensions of Space?\u201d\nThe Time Traveller smiled. \u201cAre you so sure we can move freely in Space? Right and\nleft we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. I\nadmit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation\nlimits us there.\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cThere are balloons.\u201d\n\u201cBut before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the\nsurface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.\u201d\n\u201cStill they could move a little up and down,\u201d said the Medical Man.\n\u201cEasier, far easier down than up.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the present\nmoment.\u201d\n\u201cMy dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the whole world\nhas gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present moment. Our mental\nexistences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-\n",
    "6": "Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should\ntravel down if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth\u2019s surface.\u201d\n\u201cBut the great difficulty is this,\u201d interrupted the Psychologist. \u2019You can move about\nin all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that we cannot\nmove about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to\nthe instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a\nmoment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more\nthan a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man\nis better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a\nballoon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or\naccelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other\nway?\u201d\n\u201cOh, this,\u201d began Filby, \u201cis all\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said the Time Traveller.\n\u201cIt\u2019s against reason,\u201d said Filby.\n\u201cWhat reason?\u201d said the Time Traveller.\n\u201cYou can show black is white by argument,\u201d said Filby, \u201cbut you will never convince\nme.\u201d\n\u201cPossibly not,\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cBut now you begin to see the object of my\ninvestigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of\na machine\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTo travel through Time!\u201d exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n\u201cThat shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as the driver\ndetermines.\u201d\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\n\u201cBut I have experimental verification,\u201d said the Time Traveller.\n\u201cIt would be remarkably convenient for the historian,\u201d the Psychologist suggested.\n\u201cOne might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for\ninstance!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think you would attract attention?\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cOur\nancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.\u201d\n\u201cOne might get one\u2019s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,\u201d the Very Young\nMan thought.\n\u201cIn which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The German\nscholars have improved Greek so much.\u201d\n\u201cThen there is the future,\u201d said the Very Young Man. \u201cJust think! One might invest\nall one\u2019s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!\u201d\n\u201cTo discover a society,\u201d said I, \u201cerected on a strictly communistic basis.\u201d\n\u201cOf all the wild extravagant theories!\u201d began the Psychologist.\n\u201cYes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExperimental verification!\u201d cried I. \u201cYou are going to verify that?\u201d\n\u201cThe experiment!\u201d cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\n",
    "7": "\u201cLet\u2019s see your experiment anyhow,\u201d said the Psychologist, \u201cthough it\u2019s all humbug,\nyou know.\u201d\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and with his\nhands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard his\nslippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory.\nThe Psychologist looked at us. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s got?\u201d\n\u201cSome sleight-of-hand trick or other,\u201d said the Medical Man, and Filby tried to tell us\nabout a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he had finished his preface the\nTime Traveller came back, and Filby\u2019s anecdote collapsed.\n",
    "8": "The Machine\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework,\nscarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and\nsome transparent crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that\nfollows\u2014unless his explanation is to be accepted\u2014is an absolutely unaccountable\nthing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room,\nand set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the\nmechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table\nwas a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also\nperhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several\nin sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair\nnearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller\nand the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and\nthe Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the\nleft. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It\nappears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however\nadroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.\nThe Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. \u201cWell?\u201d said the\nPsychologist.\n\u201cThis little affair,\u201d said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the table and\npressing his hands together above the apparatus, \u201cis only a model. It is my plan for a\nmachine to travel through time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that\nthere is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way\nunreal.\u201d He pointed to the part with his finger. \u201cAlso, here is one little white lever, and\nhere is another.\u201d\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing. \u201cIt\u2019s beautifully\nmade,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt took two years to make,\u201d retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we had all\nimitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: \u201cNow I want you clearly to understand\nthat this lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and this\nother reverses the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently\nI am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will vanish, pass into\nfuture Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and\nsatisfy yourselves there is no trickery. I don\u2019t want to waste this model, and then be\ntold I\u2019m a quack.\u201d\nThere was a minute\u2019s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to speak to\nme, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth his finger towards the\nlever. \u201cNo,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cLend me your hand.\u201d And turning to the Psychologist,\nhe took that individual\u2019s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that\nit was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its\ninterminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain there was no\ntrickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles\non the mantel was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became\nindistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering\n",
    "9": "brass and ivory; and it was gone\u2014vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under the table.\nAt that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. \u201cWell?\u201d he said, with a reminiscence of\nthe Psychologist. Then, getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with\nhis back to us began to fill his pipe.\nWe stared at each other. \u201cLook here,\u201d said the Medical Man, \u201care you in earnest\nabout this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the fire. Then he\nturned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist\u2019s face. (The Psychologist, to show\nthat he was not unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) \u201cWhat\nis more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there\u201d\u2014he indicated the laboratory\n\u2014\u201cand when that is put together I mean to have a journey on my own account.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?\u201d said Filby.\n\u201cInto the future or the past\u2014I don\u2019t, for certain, know which.\u201d\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. \u201cIt must have gone into the\npast if it has gone anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said the Time Traveller.\n\u201cBecause I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled into the future\nit would still be here all this time, since it must have travelled through this time.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d said I, \u201cIf it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we came\nfirst into this room; and last Thursday when we were here; and the Thursday before\nthat; and so forth!\u201d\n\u201cSerious objections,\u201d remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of impartiality,\nturning towards the Time Traveller.\n\u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: \u201cYou think. You can\nexplain that. It\u2019s presentation below the threshold, you know, diluted presentation.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said the Psychologist, and reassured us. \u201cThat\u2019s a simple point of\npsychology. I should have thought of it. It\u2019s plain enough, and helps the paradox\ndelightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, any more than we\ncan the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling\nthrough time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it gets through a\nminute while we get through a second, the impression it creates will of course be only\none-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time.\nThat\u2019s plain enough.\u201d He passed his hand through the space in which the machine had\nbeen. \u201cYou see?\u201d he said, laughing.\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time Traveller\nasked us what we thought of it all.\n\u201cIt sounds plausible enough tonight,\u201d said the Medical Man; \u201cbut wait until\ntomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.\u201d\n\u201cWould you like to see the Time Machine itself?\u201d asked the Time Traveller. And\ntherewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way down the long, draughty\ncorridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad\nhead in silhouette, the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but\n",
    "10": "incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little\nmechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts\nof ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was\ngenerally complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench\nbeside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it\nseemed to be.\n\u201cLook here,\u201d said the Medical Man, \u201care you perfectly serious? Or is this a trick\u2014like\nthat ghost you showed us last Christmas?\u201d\n\u201cUpon that machine,\u201d said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft, \u201cI intend to\nexplore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in my life.\u201d\nNone of us quite knew how to take it.\nI caught Filby\u2019s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he winked at me\nsolemnly.\n",
    "11": "The Time Traveller Returns\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. The fact is,\nthe Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed: you never\nfelt that you saw all round him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some\ningenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and\nexplained the matter in the Time Traveller\u2019s words, we should have shown him far less\nscepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could\nunderstand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his\nelements, and we distrusted him. Things that would have made the fame of a less\nclever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The\nserious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they\nwere somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like\nfurnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don\u2019t think any of us said very much\nabout time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its\nodd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its\npractical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter\nconfusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trick\nof the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday\nat the Linn\u00e6an. He said he had seen a similar thing at T\u00fcbingen, and laid considerable\nstress on the blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not\nexplain.\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond\u2014I suppose I was one of the Time\nTraveller\u2019s most constant guests\u2014and, arriving late, found four or five men already\nassembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was standing before the fire with a\nsheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time\nTraveller, and\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s half-past seven now,\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cI suppose we\u2019d better\nhave dinner?\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014\u2014?\u201d said I, naming our host.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just come? It\u2019s rather odd. He\u2019s unavoidably detained. He asks me in this\nnote to lead off with dinner at seven if he\u2019s not back. Says he\u2019ll explain when he comes.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,\u201d said the Editor of a well-known daily paper;\nand thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who had\nattended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor aforementioned, a\ncertain journalist, and another\u2014a quiet, shy man with a beard\u2014whom I didn\u2019t know,\nand who, as far as my observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There\nwas some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller\u2019s absence, and I\nsuggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that explained to\nhim, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the \u201cingenious paradox\nand trick\u201d we had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when\nthe door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and\nsaw it first. \u201cHallo!\u201d I said. \u201cAt last!\u201d And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller\nstood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. \u201cGood heavens! man, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d cried\nthe Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.\n",
    "12": "He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared with green\ndown the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me greyer\u2014either with dust\nand dirt or because its colour had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had\na brown cut on it\u2014a cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by\nintense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled\nby the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such a limp as I have\nseen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion towards the\nwine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it towards him. He drained it,\nand it seemed to do him good: for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old\nsmile flickered across his face. \u201cWhat on earth have you been up to, man?\u201d said the\nDoctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. \u201cDon\u2019t let me disturb you,\u201d he said,\nwith a certain faltering articulation. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d He stopped, held out his glass for\nmore, and took it off at a draught. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a\nfaint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull\napproval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again,\nstill as it were feeling his way among his words. \u201cI\u2019m going to wash and dress, and then\nI\u2019ll come down and explain things.... Save me some of that mutton. I\u2019m starving for a\nbit of meat.\u201d\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he was all right.\nThe Editor began a question. \u201cTell you presently,\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\nfunny! Be all right in a minute.\u201d\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I remarked his\nlameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place, I saw\nhis feet as he went out. He had nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained\nsocks. Then the door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered\nhow he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was wool-\ngathering. Then, \u201cRemarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,\u201d I heard the Editor\nsay, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this brought my attention back to the\nbright dinner-table.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the game?\u201d said the Journalist. \u201cHas he been doing the Amateur Cadger? I\ndon\u2019t follow.\u201d I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my own interpretation in his\nface. I thought of the Time Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I don\u2019t think anyone\nelse had noticed his lameness.\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man, who rang\nthe bell\u2014the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner\u2014for a hot plate.\nAt that the Editor turned to his knife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man\nfollowed suit. The dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little\nwhile with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. \u201cDoes\nour friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar\nphases?\u201d he inquired. \u201cI feel assured it\u2019s this business of the Time Machine,\u201d I said, and\ntook up the Psychologist\u2019s account of our previous meeting. The new guests were\nfrankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. \u201cWhat was this time travelling? A\nman couldn\u2019t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?\u201d And then, as\nthe idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature. Hadn\u2019t they any clothes-brushes\nin the Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor\n",
    "13": "in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind\nof journalist\u2014very joyous, irreverent young men. \u201cOur Special Correspondent in the\nDay after Tomorrow reports,\u201d the Journalist was saying\u2014or rather shouting\u2014when\nthe Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and\nnothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me.\n\u201cI say,\u201d said the Editor hilariously, \u201cthese chaps here say you have been travelling\ninto the middle of next week! Tell us all about little Rosebery, will you? What will you\ntake for the lot?\u201d\nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word. He smiled\nquietly, in his old way. \u201cWhere\u2019s my mutton?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a treat it is to stick a fork\ninto meat again!\u201d\n\u201cStory!\u201d cried the Editor.\n\u201cStory be damned!\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cI want something to eat. I won\u2019t say a\nword until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.\u201d\n\u201cOne word,\u201d said I. \u201cHave you been time travelling?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.\n\u201cI\u2019d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,\u201d said the Editor. The Time Traveller\npushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with his fingernail; at which the\nSilent Man, who had been staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him\nwine. The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions\nkept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist\ntried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller\ndevoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp. The Medical\nMan smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The\nSilent Man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with\nregularity and determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller\npushed his plate away, and looked round us. \u201cI suppose I must apologise,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nwas simply starving. I\u2019ve had a most amazing time.\u201d He reached out his hand for a\ncigar, and cut the end. \u201cBut come into the smoking-room. It\u2019s too long a story to tell\nover greasy plates.\u201d And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining\nroom.\n\u201cYou have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?\u201d he said to me,\nleaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.\n\u201cBut the thing\u2019s a mere paradox,\u201d said the Editor.\n\u201cI can\u2019t argue tonight. I don\u2019t mind telling you the story, but I can\u2019t argue. I will,\u201d he\nwent on, \u201ctell you the story of what has happened to me, if you like, but you must\nrefrain from interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be\nit! It\u2019s true\u2014every word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at four o\u2019clock, and\nsince then \u2026 I\u2019ve lived eight days \u2026 such days as no human being ever lived before! I\u2019m\nnearly worn out, but I shan\u2019t sleep till I\u2019ve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to\nbed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?\u201d\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed \u201cAgreed.\u201d And with that the\nTime Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat back in his chair at first, and\nspoke like a weary man. Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel\nwith only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink\u2014and, above all, my own\n",
    "14": "inadequacy\u2014to express its quality. You read, I will suppose, attentively enough; but\nyou cannot see the speaker\u2019s white, sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp,\nnor hear the intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the\nturns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the smoking-\nroom had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent\nMan from the knees downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at\neach other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller\u2019s\nface.\n",
    "15": "Time Travelling\n\u201cI told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, and\nshowed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop. There it is now, a little\ntravel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the\nrest of it\u2019s sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when the\nputting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one\ninch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing was not complete until\nthis morning. It was at ten o\u2019clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its\ncareer. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the\nquartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his\nskull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took the\nstarting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and\nalmost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling;\nand, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened?\nFor a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A\nmoment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly\nhalf-past three!\n\u201cI drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and went\noff with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and\nwalked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a\nminute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a\nrocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turning\nout of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The laboratory grew faint and\nhazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow night came black, then day again, night\nagain, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a\nstrange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\n\u201cI am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are\nexcessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback\u2014\nof a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an\nimminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing.\nThe dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw\nthe sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute\nmarking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the\nopen air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be\nconscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast\nfor me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the\neye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through\nher quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as\nI went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one\ncontinuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid\nluminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a\nbrilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of\nthe stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.\n\u201cThe landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside upon which this\n",
    "16": "house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim. I saw trees growing\nand changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered,\nand passed away. I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The\nwhole surface of the earth seemed changed\u2014melting and flowing under my eyes. The\nlittle hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster.\nPresently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a\nminute or less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute\nby minute the white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by\nthe bright, brief green of spring.\n\u201cThe unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They merged at\nlast into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked, indeed, a clumsy swaying of the\nmachine, for which I was unable to account. But my mind was too confused to attend\nto it, so with a kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I\nscarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. But\npresently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind\u2014a certain curiosity and\ntherewith a certain dread\u2014until at last they took complete possession of me. What\nstrange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary\ncivilisation, I thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim\nelusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid\narchitecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and\nyet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the hillside,\nand remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my\nconfusion the earth seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of\nstopping.\n\u201cThe peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space\nwhich I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled at a high velocity through\ntime, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to speak, attenuated\u2014was slipping like a vapour\nthrough the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the\njamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant\nbringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a\nprofound chemical reaction\u2014possibly a far-reaching explosion\u2014would result, and\nblow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions\u2014into the Unknown. This\npossibility had occurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; but\nthen I had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk\u2014one of the risks a man has got\nto take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light. The\nfact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and\nswaying of the machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely\nupset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I\nresolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over the lever, and\nincontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was flung headlong through the air.\n\u201cThere was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been stunned for a\nmoment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was sitting on soft turf in front of\nthe overset machine. Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the\nconfusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little\nlawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve\nand purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hailstones.\nThe rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud over the machine, and drove along\n",
    "17": "the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin. \u2018Fine hospitality,\u2019 said I, \u2018to a\nman who has travelled innumerable years to see you.\u2019\n\u201cPresently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and looked round me. A\ncolossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the\nrhododendrons through the hazy downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\n\u201cMy sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew thinner, I\nsaw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for a silver birch-tree touched\nits shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the\nwings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to\nhover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It\nchanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there\nwas the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that\nimparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space\u2014\nhalf a minute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail\ndrove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment, and saw\nthat the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lightening with the\npromise of the sun.\n\u201cI looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity of my voyage\ncame suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether\nwithdrawn? What might not have happened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a\ncommon passion? What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness, and had\ndeveloped into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I\nmight seem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and disgusting for\nour common likeness\u2014a foul creature to be incontinently slain.\n\u201cAlready I saw other vast shapes\u2014huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall\ncolumns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening\nstorm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and\nstrove hard to readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the\nthunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing\ngarments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint\nbrown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings about me stood\nout clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out in\nwhite by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I felt naked in a strange\nworld. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above\nand will swoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and\nagain grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under my desperate\nonset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One hand on the saddle, the other\non the lever, I stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again.\n\u201cBut with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I looked more\ncuriously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future. In a circular opening,\nhigh up in the wall of the nearer house, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes.\nThey had seen me, and their faces were directed towards me.\n\u201cThen I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the White\nSphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these emerged in a\npathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I stood with my machine. He\nwas a slight creature\u2014perhaps four feet high\u2014clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the\n",
    "18": "waist with a leather belt. Sandals or buskins\u2014I could not clearly distinguish which\u2014\nwere on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing that, I\nnoticed for the first time how warm the air was.\n\u201cHe struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably\nfrail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive\u2014that\nhectic beauty of which we used to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly\nregained confidence. I took my hands from the machine.\n",
    "19": "In the Golden Age\n\u201cIn another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing out of\nfuturity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The absence from his\nbearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to the two others who\nwere following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\n\u201cThere were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of\nthese exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It came into my\nhead, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my\nhead, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and\nthen touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and\nshoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all\nalarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired\nconfidence\u2014a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so\nfrail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins.\nBut I made a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at\nthe Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had\nhitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the little\nlevers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to\nsee what I could do in the way of communication.\n\u201cAnd then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities\nin their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came\nto a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the\nface, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red,\nrather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and\u2014\nthis may seem egotism on my part\u2014I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the\ninterest I might have expected in them.\n\u201cAs they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round me\nsmiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the conversation. I\npointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then, hesitating for a moment how to\nexpress Time, I pointed to the sun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered\npurple and white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound\nof thunder.\n\u201cFor a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was plain enough.\nThe question had come into my mind abruptly: were these creatures fools? You may\nhardly understand how it took me. You see, I had always anticipated that the people of\nthe year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in\nknowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that\nshowed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old children\u2014asked\nme, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I\nhad suspended upon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of\ndisappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had built the Time\nMachine in vain.\n\u201cI nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of a\nthunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and bowed. Then came\n",
    "20": "one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me,\nand put it about my neck. The idea was received with melodious applause; and\npresently they were all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them\nupon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like\ncan scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture\nhad created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the\nnearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble, which had seemed\nto watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice\nof fretted stone. As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a\nprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible merriment, to my\nmind.\n\u201cThe building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal dimensions. I was\nnaturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people, and with the big open\nportals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the\nworld I saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a\nlong neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of strange white\nflowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals. They grew\nscattered, as if wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them\nclosely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the turf among the\nrhododendrons.\n\u201cThe arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not observe the\ncarving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of old Ph\u0153nician\ndecorations as I passed through, and it struck me that they were very badly broken and\nweather-worn. Several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we\nentered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough,\ngarlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright, soft-coloured\nrobes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.\n\u201cThe big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown. The\nroof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with coloured glass and\npartially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The floor was made up of huge blocks of\nsome very hard white metal, not plates nor slabs\u2014blocks, and it was so much worn, as\nI judged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along\nthe more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of\nslabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from the floor, and upon these were\nheaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but\nfor the most part they were strange.\n\u201cBetween the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon these my\nconductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise. With a pretty absence of\nceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so\nforth, into the round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their\nexample, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall at my leisure.\n\u201cAnd perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look. The stained-\nglass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern, were broken in many\nplaces, and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust. And it\ncaught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,\nthe general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of\n",
    "21": "hundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to me as they could\ncome, were watching me with interest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were\neating. All were clad in the same soft, and yet strong, silky material.\n\u201cFruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote future were strict\nvegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of some carnal cravings, I had to be\nfrugivorous also. Indeed, I found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had\nfollowed the Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful; one, in\nparticular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was there\u2014a floury thing in a\nthree-sided husk\u2014was especially good, and I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled\nby all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to\nperceive their import.\n\u201cHowever, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now. So soon as\nmy appetite was a little checked, I determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the\nspeech of these new men of mine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits\nseemed a convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series\nof interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty in conveying\nmy meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable\nlaughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and\nrepeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each\nother, and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language\ncaused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement. However, I felt like a\nschoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun\nsubstantives at least at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and\neven the verb \u2018to eat.\u2019 But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted\nto get away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity, to let them\ngive their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found\nthey were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued.\n",
    "22": "The Sunset of Mankind\n\u201cA queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was their lack of\ninterest. They would come to me with eager cries of astonishment, like children, but,\nlike children they would soon stop examining me, and wander away after some other\ntoy. The dinner and my conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that\nalmost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how speedily\nI came to disregard these little people. I went out through the portal into the sunlit\nworld again as soon as my hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of\nthese men of the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about\nme, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my own\ndevices.\n\u201cThe calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great hall, and the\nscene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At first things were very confusing.\nEverything was so entirely different from the world I had known\u2014even the flowers.\nThe big building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the\nThames had shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to mount to\nthe summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from which I could get a wider\nview of this our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred\nand One, A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little dials of my machine\nrecorded.\n\u201cAs I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly help to\nexplain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the world\u2014for ruinous it\nwas. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a great heap of granite, bound together\nby masses of aluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps,\namidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants\u2014nettles possibly\n\u2014but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of stinging. It\nwas evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not\ndetermine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have a very strange\nexperience\u2014the first intimation of a still stranger discovery\u2014but of that I will speak in\nits proper place.\n\u201cLooking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested for a\nwhile, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen. Apparently the single\nhouse, and possibly even the household, had vanished. Here and there among the\ngreenery were palace-like buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such\ncharacteristic features of our own English landscape, had disappeared.\n\u201c\u2018Communism,\u2019 said I to myself.\n\u201cAnd on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the half-dozen little\nfigures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I perceived that all had the same form\nof costume, the same soft hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It\nmay seem strange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so\nstrange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the differences of\ntexture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other, these people of the\nfuture were alike. And the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their\nparents. I judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious,\n",
    "23": "physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion.\n\u201cSeeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt that this close\nresemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect; for the strength of a man\nand the softness of a woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of\noccupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where\npopulation is balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than\na blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure, there\nis less necessity\u2014indeed there is no necessity\u2014for an efficient family, and the\nspecialisation of the sexes with reference to their children\u2019s needs disappears. We see\nsome beginnings of this even in our own time, and in this future age it was complete.\nThis, I must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate\nhow far it fell short of the reality.\n\u201cWhile I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a pretty\nlittle structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a transitory way of the oddness\nof wells still existing, and then resumed the thread of my speculations. There were no\nlarge buildings towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently\nmiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a strange sense of\nfreedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\n\u201cThere I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognise, corroded in\nplaces with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss, the arm-rests cast\nand filed into the resemblance of griffins\u2019 heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the\nbroad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair\na view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon and the west\nwas flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson. Below\nwas the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I\nhave already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery,\nsome in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure in\nthe waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of some\ncupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of\nagriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.\n\u201cSo watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had seen, and as it\nshaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was something in this way.\n(Afterwards I found I had got only a half truth\u2014or only a glimpse of one facet of the\ntruth.)\n\u201cIt seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The ruddy\nsunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first time I began to realise an\nodd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come\nto think, it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security\nsets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions of life\u2014the\ntrue civilising process that makes life more and more secure\u2014had gone steadily on to a\nclimax. One triumph of a united humanity over Nature had followed another. Things\nthat are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried\nforward. And the harvest was what I saw!\n\u201cAfter all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in the rudimentary\nstage. The science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of\nhuman disease, but, even so, it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently.\n",
    "24": "Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate\nperhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a\nbalance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and animals\u2014and how few they\nare\u2014gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless\ngrape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We\nimprove them gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our\nknowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands.\nSome day all this will be better organised, and still better. That is the drift of the\ncurrent in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-\noperating; things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the\nend, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to\nsuit our human needs.\n\u201cThis adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done indeed for all\nTime, in the space of Time across which my machine had leapt. The air was free from\ngnats, the earth from weeds or fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful\nflowers; brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine\nwas attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any contagious\ndiseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you later that even the processes of\nputrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.\n\u201cSocial triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in splendid\nshelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them engaged in no toil. There were\nno signs of struggle, neither social nor economical struggle. The shop, the\nadvertisement, traffic, all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was\ngone. It was natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a social\nparadise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met, I guessed, and\npopulation had ceased to increase.\n\u201cBut with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change.\nWhat, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the cause of human intelligence\nand vigour? Hardship and freedom: conditions under which the active, strong, and\nsubtle survive and the weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the\nloyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision. And the\ninstitution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the\ntenderness for offspring, parental self-devotion, all found their justification and\nsupport in the imminent dangers of the young. Now, where are these imminent\ndangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubial jealousy,\nagainst fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts; unnecessary things now, and\nthings that make us uncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and\npleasant life.\n\u201cI thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of intelligence, and\nthose big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of\nNature. For after the battle comes Quiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and\nintelligent, and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it\nlived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\n\u201cUnder the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that restless energy,\nthat with us is strength, would become weakness. Even in our own time certain\ntendencies and desires, once necessary to survival, are a constant source of failure.\n",
    "25": "Physical courage and the love of battle, for instance, are no great help\u2014may even be\nhindrances\u2014to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and security, power,\nintellectual as well as physical, would be out of place. For countless years I judged there\nhad been no danger of war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting\ndisease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life, what we\nshould call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak.\nBetter equipped indeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which\nthere was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the\noutcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it\nsettled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived\u2014the\nflourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has ever been the fate\nof energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor and decay.\n\u201cEven this artistic impetus would at last die away\u2014had almost died in the Time I\nsaw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the sunlight: so much was\nleft of the artistic spirit, and no more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented\ninactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to\nme that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!\n\u201cAs I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple explanation I\nhad mastered the problem of the world\u2014mastered the whole secret of these delicious\npeople. Possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had\nsucceeded too well, and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary.\nThat would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and\nplausible enough\u2014as most wrong theories are!\n",
    "26": "A Sudden Shock\n\u201cAs I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full moon,\nyellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north-east. The\nbright little figures ceased to move about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I\nshivered with the chill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could\nsleep.\n\u201cI looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the figure of the\nWhite Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing distinct as the light of the rising\nmoon grew brighter. I could see the silver birch against it. There was the tangle of\nrhododendron bushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at\nthe lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. \u2018No,\u2019 said I stoutly to myself,\n\u2018that was not the lawn.\u2019\n\u201cBut it was the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it. Can\nyou imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to me? But you cannot. The Time\nMachine was gone!\n\u201cAt once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing my own age, of\nbeing left helpless in this strange new world. The bare thought of it was an actual\nphysical sensation. I could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In\nanother moment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping strides\ndown the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the\nblood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the\ntime I ran I was saying to myself: \u2018They have moved it a little, pushed it under the\nbushes out of the way.\u2019 Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the time, with the\ncertainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was\nfolly, knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath\ncame with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little\nlawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. I cursed aloud, as\nI ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I\ncried aloud, and none answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit\nworld.\n\u201cWhen I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace of the thing was\nto be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty space among the black tangle of\nbushes. I ran round it furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then\nstopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx,\nupon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising moon. It\nseemed to smile in mockery of my dismay.\n\u201cI might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the\nmechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their physical and\nintellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the sense of some hitherto\nunsuspected power, through whose intervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for\none thing I felt assured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate, the\nmachine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the levers\u2014I will show you\nthe method later\u2014prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they\nwere removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?\n",
    "27": "\u201cI think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently in and out\namong the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling some white animal that,\nin the dim light, I took for a small deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the\nbushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the\nbroken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the\ngreat building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the\nuneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a\nmatch and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.\n\u201cThere I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which, perhaps, a\nscore or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no doubt they found my second\nappearance strange enough, coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with\ninarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about\nmatches. \u2018Where is my Time Machine?\u2019 I began, bawling like an angry child, laying\nhands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to\nthem. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw them\nstanding round me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was\npossible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.\nFor, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must be forgotten.\n\u201cAbruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people over in my\ncourse, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out under the moonlight. I\nheard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that. I do\nnot remember all I did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected\nnature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind\u2014a\nstrange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro, screaming and\ncrying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible fatigue, as the long night of\ndespair wore away; of looking in this impossible place and that; of groping among\nmoonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on\nthe ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at\nthe folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. I had nothing\nleft but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple of\nsparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm.\n\u201cI sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had got there,\nand why I had such a profound sense of desertion and despair. Then things came clear\nin my mind. With the plain, reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly\nin the face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself.\n\u2018Suppose the worst?\u2019 I said. \u2018Suppose the machine altogether lost\u2014perhaps destroyed?\nIt behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear idea\nof the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the\nend, perhaps, I may make another.\u2019 That would be my only hope, a poor hope, perhaps,\nbut better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautiful and curious world.\n\u201cBut probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must be calm and\npatient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or cunning. And with that I\nscrambled to my feet and looked about me, wondering where I could bathe. I felt\nweary, stiff, and travel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal\nfreshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found\nmyself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful examination\nof the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings,\n",
    "28": "conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They all failed to\nunderstand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and\nlaughed at me. I had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty\nlaughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger\nwas ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity. The turf gave better\ncounsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal of the\nsphinx and the marks of my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned\nmachine. There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints like\nthose I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer attention to the\npedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly\ndecorated with deep framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The\npedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with\nthe frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they were\ndoors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It\ntook no very great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that\npedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.\n\u201cI saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and under\nsome blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling to them, and\nbeckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to\nintimate my wish to open it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very\noddly. I don\u2019t know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a\ngrossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman\u2014it is how she would look. They\nwent off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little\nchap in white next, with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel\nashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once\nmore. As he turned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three strides\nI was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began\ndragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his face,\nand all of a sudden I let him go.\n\u201cBut I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels. I thought I\nheard something stir inside\u2014to be explicit, I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle\u2014\nbut I must have been mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and\nhammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in\npowdery flakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty\noutbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them\nupon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down to watch the\nplace. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could\nwork at a problem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours\u2014that is\nanother matter.\n\u201cI got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the\nhill again. \u2018Patience,\u2019 said I to myself. \u2018If you want your machine again you must leave\nthat sphinx alone. If they mean to take your machine away, it\u2019s little good your\nwrecking their bronze panels, and if they don\u2019t, you will get it back as soon as you can\nask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless.\nThat way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too\nhasty guesses at its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.\u2019 Then suddenly the\nhumour of the situation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in\n",
    "29": "study and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it.\nI had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man\ndevised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.\n\u201cGoing through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people avoided me. It\nmay have been my fancy, or it may have had something to do with my hammering at\nthe gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to\nshow no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or\ntwo things got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the language,\nand in addition I pushed my explorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle\npoint or their language was excessively simple\u2014almost exclusively composed of\nconcrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or\nlittle use of figurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two words,\nand I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined to\nput the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the\nsphinx, as much as possible in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge\nwould lead me back to them in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may\nunderstand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\n",
    "30": "Explanation\n\u201cSo far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the\nThames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same abundance of splendid\nbuildings, endlessly varied in material and style, the same clustering thickets of\nevergreens, the same blossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone\nlike silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so faded into the\nserenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently attracted my attention, was the\npresence of certain circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One\nlay by the path up the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others, it\nwas rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the\nrain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness, I\ncould see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection with a lighted match. But\nin all of them I heard a certain sound: a thud\u2014thud\u2014thud, like the beating of some big\nengine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of air\nset down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one, and,\ninstead of fluttering slowly down, it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight.\n\u201cAfter a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and\nthere upon the slopes; for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as\none sees on a hot day above a sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a\nstrong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose true\nimport it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to associate it with the\nsanitary apparatus of these people. It was an obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely\nwrong.\n\u201cAnd here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells and modes of\nconveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in this real future. In some of\nthese visions of Utopias and coming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of\ndetail about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are\neasy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one\u2019s imagination, they\nare altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as I found here.\nConceive the tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back\nto his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of social movements, of\ntelephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders and\nthe like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain these things to him! And\neven of what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either\napprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white\nman of our own times, and how wide the interval between myself and these of the\nGolden Age! I was sensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my\ncomfort; but save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I can\nconvey very little of the difference to your mind.\n\u201cIn the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of crematoria nor\nanything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me that, possibly, there might be\ncemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere beyond the range of my explorings. This, again,\nwas a question I deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely\ndefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a further remark,\n",
    "31": "which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among this people there were none.\n\u201cI must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic\ncivilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet I could think of no other.\nLet me put my difficulties. The several big palaces I had explored were mere living\nplaces, great dining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no\nappliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at\ntimes need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly complex\nspecimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And the little people\ndisplayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no\nsign of importations among them. They spent all their time in playing gently, in\nbathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and\nsleeping. I could not see how things were kept going.\n\u201cThen, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had taken it\ninto the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For the life of me I could not\nimagine. Those waterless wells, too, those flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt\u2014\nhow shall I put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in\nexcellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of words, of letters\neven, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third day of my visit, that was how the\nworld of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to\nme!\n\u201cThat day, too, I made a friend\u2014of a sort. It happened that, as I was watching some\nof the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was seized with cramp and began\ndrifting downstream. The main current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for\neven a moderate swimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency\nin these creatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the\nweakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. When I realised this, I\nhurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I caught the\npoor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her\nround, and I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to\nsuch a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her. In that,\nhowever, I was wrong.\n\u201cThis happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman, as I believe\nit was, as I was returning towards my centre from an exploration, and she received me\nwith cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers\u2014evidently made\nfor me and me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling\ndesolate. At any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We were soon\nseated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The\ncreature\u2019s friendliness affected me exactly as a child\u2019s might have done. We passed\neach other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk,\nand found that her name was Weena, which, though I don\u2019t know what it meant,\nsomehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship\nwhich lasted a week, and ended\u2014as I will tell you!\n\u201cShe was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She tried to follow\nme everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her\ndown, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the\nproblems of the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the\n",
    "32": "future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was very great,\nher expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had\nas much trouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very\ngreat comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until\nit was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor\nuntil it was too late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely\nseeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she cared for me, the\nlittle doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White\nSphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of\nwhite and gold so soon as I came over the hill.\n\u201cIt was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the world. She was\nfearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest confidence in me; for once, in a\nfoolish moment, I made threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them.\nBut she dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was\nthe one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set me thinking\nand observing. I discovered then, among other things, that these little people gathered\ninto the great houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a\nlight was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or\none sleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a blockhead that I\nmissed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of Weena\u2019s distress, I insisted upon sleeping\naway from these slumbering multitudes.\n\u201cIt troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed, and for\nfive of the nights of our acquaintance, including the last night of all, she slept with her\nhead pillowed on my arm. But my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must\nhave been the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been\nrestless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea anemones were\nfeeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a start, and with an odd fancy\nthat some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep\nagain, but I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are\njust creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut, and yet\nunreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in\nfront of the palace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.\n\u201cThe moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were\nmingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black, the ground a sombre grey,\nthe sky colourless and cheerless. And up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. Three\nseveral times, as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a\nsolitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the\nruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved hastily. I did not see\nwhat became of them. It seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was\nstill indistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning\nfeeling you may have known. I doubted my eyes.\n\u201cAs the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and its vivid\ncolouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the view keenly. But I saw no\nvestige of my white figures. They were mere creatures of the half-light. \u2018They must\nhave been ghosts,\u2019 I said; \u2018I wonder whence they dated.\u2019 For a queer notion of Grant\nAllen\u2019s came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts, he\nargued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that theory they would\n",
    "33": "have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no\ngreat wonder to see four at once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of\nthese figures all the morning, until Weena\u2019s rescue drove them out of my head. I\nassociated them in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my\nfirst passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet\nall the same, they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.\n\u201cI think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this Golden\nAge. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was hotter, or the earth nearer the\nsun. It is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But\npeople, unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that\nthe planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As these\ncatastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and it may be that some\ninner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the sun\nwas very much hotter than we know it.\n\u201cWell, one very hot morning\u2014my fourth, I think\u2014as I was seeking shelter from the\nheat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I slept and fed, there\nhappened this strange thing. Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a\nnarrow gallery, whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.\nBy contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I\nentered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim\nbefore me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against\nthe daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.\n\u201cThe old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my hands and\nsteadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to turn. Then the thought of\nthe absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And\nthen I remembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some\nextent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and ill-\ncontrolled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once the eyes darted\nsideways, and something white ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and\nsaw a queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar manner, running\nacross the sunlit space behind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered\naside, and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined\nmasonry.\n\u201cMy impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull white, and had\nstrange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its\nback. But, as I say, it went too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it\nran on all fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant\u2019s pause I\nfollowed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it at first; but, after a time in\nthe profound obscurity, I came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I\nhave told you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this\nThing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a small,\nwhite, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it\nretreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down\nthe wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests\nforming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out\nof my hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had\ndisappeared.\n",
    "34": "\u201cI do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for some time that\nI could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I had seen was human. But,\ngradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man had not remained one species, but had\ndifferentiated into two distinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper World\nwere not the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene,\nnocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the ages.\n\u201cI thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation.\nI began to suspect their true import. And what, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in\nmy scheme of a perfectly balanced organisation? How was it related to the indolent\nserenity of the beautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot\nof that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any rate, there was\nnothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And\nwithal I was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld\npeople came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The\nmale pursued the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.\n\u201cThey seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned pillar, peering\ndown the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures; for\nwhen I pointed to this one, and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue, they\nwere still more visibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my\nmatches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and\nagain I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena, and see what I\ncould get from her. But my mind was already in revolution; my guesses and\nimpressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the\nimport of these wells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say\nnothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time Machine!\nAnd very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic\nproblem that had puzzled me.\n\u201cHere was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was subterranean.\nThere were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare\nemergence above ground was the outcome of a long-continued underground habit. In\nthe first place, there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely\nin the dark\u2014the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,\nwith that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of nocturnal things\u2014\nwitness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that\nhasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of\nthe head while in the light\u2014all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the\nretina.\n\u201cBeneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and these\ntunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of ventilating shafts and\nwells along the hill slopes\u2014everywhere, in fact, except along the river valley\u2014showed\nhow universal were its ramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was\nin this artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the\ndaylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once accepted it, and\nwent on to assume the how of this splitting of the human species. I dare say you will\nanticipate the shape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far\nshort of the truth.\n",
    "35": "\u201cAt first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear as daylight\nto me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference\nbetween the Capitalist and the Labourer was the key to the whole position. No doubt it\nwill seem grotesque enough to you\u2014and wildly incredible!\u2014and yet even now there\nare existing circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to utilise\nunderground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation; there is the\nMetropolitan Railway in London, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are\nsubways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and\nmultiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had gradually\nlost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and\never larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of its time\ntherein, till, in the end\u2014! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial\nconditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth?\n\u201cAgain, the exclusive tendency of richer people\u2014due, no doubt, to the increasing\nrefinement of their education, and the widening gulf between them and the rude\nviolence of the poor\u2014is already leading to the closing, in their interest, of considerable\nportions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the\nprettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf\u2014which is\ndue to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased\nfacilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich\u2014will make\nthat exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage which at\npresent retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification, less and\nless frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure\nand comfort and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting\ncontinually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they were there, they\nwould no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their\ncaverns; and if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of\nthem as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in the\nend, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted to the\nconditions of underground life, and as happy in their way, as the Overworld people\nwere to theirs. As it seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed\nnaturally enough.\n\u201cThe great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape in my\nmind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general co-operation as I\nhad imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy, armed with a perfected science and\nworking to a logical conclusion the industrial system of today. Its triumph had not\nbeen simply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man.\nThis, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in the\npattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it\nis the most plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced civilisation that\nwas at last attained must have long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into\ndecay. The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow movement\nof degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and intelligence. That I could\nsee clearly enough already. What had happened to the Undergrounders I did not yet\nsuspect; but, from what I had seen of the Morlocks\u2014that, by the bye, was the name by\nwhich these creatures were called\u2014I could imagine that the modification of the\nhuman type was even far more profound than among the \u2018Eloi,\u2019 the beautiful race that\n",
    "36": "I already knew.\n\u201cThen came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time Machine?\nFor I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the Eloi were masters, could\nthey not restore the machine to me? And why were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I\nproceeded, as I have said, to question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I\nwas disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and presently she\nrefused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic was unendurable. And when\nI pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears,\nexcept my own, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to\ntrouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her\nhuman inheritance from Weena\u2019s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and clapping\nher hands, while I solemnly burnt a match.\n",
    "37": "The Morlocks\n\u201cIt may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up the new-\nfound clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a peculiar shrinking from\nthose pallid bodies. They were just the half-bleached colour of the worms and things\none sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the\ntouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi,\nwhose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate.\n\u201cThe next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little disordered. I\nwas oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I had a feeling of intense fear\nfor which I could perceive no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the\ngreat hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight\u2014that night Weena\nwas among them\u2014and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even\nthen, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter, and\nthe nights grow dark, when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below,\nthese whitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be more\nabundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an\ninevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by\nboldly penetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the mystery. If\nonly I had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so horribly alone,\nand even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me. I don\u2019t know if\nyou will understand my feeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.\n\u201cIt was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me farther and farther\nafield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the south-westward towards the rising\ncountry that is now called Combe Wood, I observed far-off, in the direction of\nnineteenth-century Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I\nhad hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and the\nfa\u00e7ade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green\ntint, a kind of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in\naspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the\nday was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring\ncircuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I returned to\nthe welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly\nenough that my curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-\ndeception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I\nwould make the descent without further waste of time, and started out in the early\nmorning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium.\n\u201cLittle Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when she saw me\nlean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely disconcerted. \u2018Good-\nbye, little Weena,\u2019 I said, kissing her; and then putting her down, I began to feel over\nthe parapet for the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared\nmy courage might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a\nmost piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with her little hands. I\nthink her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little\nroughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I saw her agonised face\n",
    "38": "over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable\nhooks to which I clung.\n\u201cI had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The descent was\neffected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well, and these\nbeing adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was\nspeedily cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the\nbars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness\nbeneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I did not dare to\nrest again. Though my arms and back were presently acutely painful, I went on\nclambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing\nupward, I saw the aperture, a small blue disc, in which a star was visible, while little\nWeena\u2019s head showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine\nbelow grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disc above was\nprofoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had disappeared.\n\u201cI was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up the shaft\nagain, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I turned this over in my mind I\ncontinued to descend. At last, with intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the\nright of me, a slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the\naperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and rest. It was not\ntoo soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I was trembling with the\nprolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness had had a distressing\neffect upon my eyes. The air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air\ndown the shaft.\n\u201cI do not know how long I lay. I was arroused by a soft hand touching my face.\nStarting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and, hastily striking one, I saw\nthree stooping white creatures similar to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin,\nhastily retreating before the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me\nimpenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are the\npupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the same way. I have no\ndoubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any\nfear of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in order to see them,\nthey fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which their\neyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.\n\u201cI tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently different from\nthat of the Overworld people; so that I was needs left to my own unaided efforts, and\nthe thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind. But I said to\nmyself, \u2018You are in for it now,\u2019 and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise\nof machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I came to a large\nopen space, and striking another match, saw that I had entered a vast arched cavern,\nwhich stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it\nwas as much as one could see in the burning of a match.\n\u201cNecessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose out of the\ndimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim spectral Morlocks sheltered\nfrom the glare. The place, by the bye, was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint\nhalitus of freshly-shed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a\nlittle table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate were\n",
    "39": "carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large animal could have\nsurvived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the\nbig unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting\nfor the darkness to come at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung my\nfingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.\n\u201cI have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an experience.\nWhen I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with the absurd assumption\nthat the men of the Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their\nappliances. I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke\u2014\nat times I missed tobacco frightfully!\u2014even without enough matches. If only I had\nthought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld in a second,\nand examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the\npowers that Nature had endowed me with\u2014hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four\nsafety-matches that still remained to me.\n\u201cI was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark, and it was\nonly with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store of matches had run low. It\nhad never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economise\nthem, and I had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom\nfire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand\ntouched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar\nunpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little\nbeings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and\nother hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures\nexamining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my ignorance\nof their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I\nshouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then I could feel them\napproaching me again. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to\neach other. I shivered violently, and shouted again\u2014rather discordantly. This time\nthey were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they\ncame back at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined to strike\nanother match and escape under the protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the\nflicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow\ntunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness\nI could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves, and pattering like the rain,\nas they hurried after me.\n\u201cIn a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking that\nthey were trying to haul me back. I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled\nfaces. You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked\u2014those pale,\nchinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!\u2014as they stared in their blindness\nand bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated again, and when\nmy second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost burnt through when I\nreached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great\npump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did\nso, my feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my\nlast match \u2026 and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars\nnow, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks, and\nwas speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up at me:\n",
    "40": "all but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot\nas a trophy.\n\u201cThat climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty feet of it a\ndeadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. The last\nfew yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam,\nand I felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth\nsomehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face.\nEven the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and\nears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.\n",
    "41": "When Night Came\n\u201cNow, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except during my\nnight\u2019s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate\nescape, but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely\nthought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and by some\nunknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an\naltogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks\u2014a something\ninhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might\nfeel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.\nNow I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.\n\u201cThe enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new moon.\nWeena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the\nDark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming\nDark Nights might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer\ninterval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of\nthe fear of the little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul\nvillainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now\nthat my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld people might once have\nbeen the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but that\nhad long since passed away. The two species that had resulted from the evolution of\nman were sliding down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new\nrelationship. The Eloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful\nfutility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean\nfor innumerable generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable.\nAnd the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their\nhabitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a\nstanding horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because\nancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old\norder was already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on\napace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of\nthe ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back\u2014changed! Already\nthe Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were becoming reacquainted\nwith Fear. And suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat I had seen\nin the Underworld. It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were\nby the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I\ntried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar, but I could not\ntell what it was at the time.\n\u201cStill, however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious Fear, I\nwas differently constituted. I came out of this age of ours, this ripe prime of the human\nrace, when Fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would\ndefend myself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness\nwhere I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this strange world with\nsome of that confidence I had lost in realising to what creatures night by night I lay\nexposed. I felt I could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I\n",
    "42": "shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me.\n\u201cI wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but found\nnothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the buildings and trees\nseemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their\nwells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished\ngleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena like a\nchild upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the south-west. The distance, I\nhad reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had\nfirst seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In\naddition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through the\nsole\u2014they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors\u2014so that I was lame. And it\nwas already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black\nagainst the pale yellow of the sky.\n\u201cWeena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a while she\ndesired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me, occasionally darting off on\neither hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled\nWeena, but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for\nfloral decoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that reminds me! In\nchanging my jacket I found\u2026\u201d\nThe Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed two\nwithered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table. Then he\nresumed his narrative.\n\u201cAs the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest\ntowards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey\nstone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her,\nand contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her\nFear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the\nbreeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that evening\nstillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down\nin the sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my fears. In that\ndarkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel\nthe hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the\nMorlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark. In my\nexcitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a\ndeclaration of war. And why had they taken my Time Machine?\n\u201cSo we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The clear blue of\nthe distance faded, and one star after another came out. The ground grew dim and the\ntrees black. Weena\u2019s fears and her fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and\ntalked to her and caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms\nround my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So\nwe went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I almost walked into\na little river. This I waded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number of\nsleeping houses, and by a statue\u2014a Faun, or some such figure, minus the head. Here too\nwere acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night,\nand the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come.\n\u201cFrom the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before\n",
    "43": "me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to the right or the left. Feeling\ntired\u2014my feet, in particular, were very sore\u2014I carefully lowered Weena from my\nshoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of\nGreen Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the thickness of the\nwood and thought of what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one\nwould be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking danger\u2014a danger I\ndid not care to let my imagination loose upon\u2014there would still be all the roots to\nstumble over and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after the\nexcitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night\nupon the open hill.\n\u201cWeena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in my jacket,\nand sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The hillside was quiet and deserted,\nbut from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things. Above\nme shone the stars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly\ncomfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however:\nthat slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long\nsince rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me,\nwas still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it)\nwas a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own\ngreen Sirius. And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone\nkindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.\n\u201cLooking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of\nterrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the slow inevitable drift\nof their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of\nthe great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty times had\nthat silent revolution occurred during all the years that I had traversed. And during\nthese few revolutions all the activity, all the traditions, the complex organisations, the\nnations, languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew\nhim, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who had\nforgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went in terror. Then I\nthought of the Great Fear that was between the two species, and for the first time, with\na sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it\nwas too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white and\nstarlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought.\n\u201cThrough that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I could, and\nwhiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of the old constellations in\nthe new confusion. The sky kept very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I\ndozed at times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like\nthe reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and\nwhite. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at\nfirst, and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had\nseen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost\nseemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with\nthe loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took\noff my shoes, and flung them away.\n\u201cI awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and pleasant\ninstead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith to break our fast. We\n",
    "44": "soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though\nthere was no such thing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the\nmeat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my\nheart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time\nin the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks\u2019 food had run short. Possibly they had\nlived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating and\nexclusive in his food than he was\u2014far less than any monkey. His prejudice against\nhuman flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men\u2014\u2014! I tried\nto look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more\nremote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. And the\nintelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone. Why should\nI trouble myself? These Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks\npreserved and preyed upon\u2014probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena\ndancing at my side!\n\u201cThen I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me, by\nregarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man had been content to\nlive in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his\nwatchword and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I\neven tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this attitude of\nmind was impossible. However great their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept\ntoo much of the human form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a\nsharer in their degradation and their Fear.\n\u201cI had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My first was to\nsecure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as I\ncould contrive. That necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure\nsome means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I\nknew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to arrange some\ncontrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a\nbattering ram. I had a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of\nlight before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the\nMorlocks were strong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring with\nme to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way\ntowards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.\n",
    "45": "The Palace of Green Porcelain\n\u201cI found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about noon, deserted\nand falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and great\nsheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It\nlay very high upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was\nsurprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged Wandsworth and\nBattersea must once have been. I thought then\u2014though I never followed up the\nthought\u2014of what might have happened, or might be happening, to the living things in\nthe sea.\n\u201cThe material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, and\nalong the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown character. I thought, rather\nfoolishly, that Weena might help me to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare\nidea of writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more\nhuman than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.\n\u201cWithin the big valves of the door\u2014which were open and broken\u2014we found,\ninstead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows. At the first\nglance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a\nremarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering.\nThen I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly\nthe lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some\nextinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones\nlay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had dropped through\na leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the\nhuge skeleton barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going\ntowards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away the\nthick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they must have\nbeen air-tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents.\n\u201cClearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington! Here,\napparently, was the Pal\u00e6ontological Section, and a very splendid array of fossils it\nmust have been, though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a\ntime, and had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine\nhundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme\nslowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of the little\npeople in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds.\nAnd the cases had in some instances been bodily removed\u2014by the Morlocks, as I\njudged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who\nhad been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came, as I\nstared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me.\n\u201cAnd at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual\nage that I gave no thought to the possibilities it presented. Even my preoccupation\nabout the Time Machine receded a little from my mind.\n\u201cTo judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain had a great deal\nmore in it than a Gallery of Pal\u00e6ontology; possibly historical galleries; it might be, even\na library! To me, at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more\n",
    "46": "interesting than this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another\nshort gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals,\nand the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could\nfind no saltpetre; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages\nago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the rest of\nthe contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I\nsaw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on down a very\nruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section\nhad been devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of\nrecognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed\nanimals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a brown dust of\ndeparted plants: that was all! I was sorry for that, because I should have been glad to\ntrace the patient readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been\nattained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly ill-\nlit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which I entered.\nAt intervals white globes hung from the ceiling\u2014many of them cracked and smashed\n\u2014which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in\nmy element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines, all\ngreatly corroded and many broken down, but some still fairly complete. You know I\nhave a certain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the\nmore so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the\nvaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their puzzles I\nshould find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the Morlocks.\n\u201cSuddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she startled me. Had\nit not been for her I do not think I should have noticed that the floor of the gallery\nsloped at all. [Footnote: It may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the\nmuseum was built into the side of a hill.\u2014ED.] The end I had come in at was quite\nabove ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down the length, the\nground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit like the \u2018area\u2018 of a\nLondon house before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly\nalong, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the\ngradual diminution of the light, until Weena\u2019s increasing apprehensions drew my\nattention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I\nhesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant and its\nsurface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a\nnumber of small narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the\nMorlocks revived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic\nexamination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the\nafternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire.\nAnd then down in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and\nthe same odd noises I had heard down the well.\n\u201cI took Weena\u2019s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and turned to a\nmachine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal-box. Clambering\nupon the stand, and grasping this lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it\nsideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had\njudged the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute\u2019s strain,\nand I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for any\n",
    "47": "Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very\ninhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one\u2019s own descendants! But it was\nimpossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to\nleave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time\nMachine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing\nthe brutes I heard.\n\u201cWell, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that gallery and into\nanother and still larger one, which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel\nhung with tattered flags. The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I\npresently recognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped to\npieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here and there were warped\nboards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary\nman I might, perhaps, have moralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was,\nthe thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to\nwhich this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I will confess that I\nthought chiefly of the Philosophical Transactions and my own seventeen papers upon\nphysical optics.\n\u201cThen, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery of\ntechnical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of useful discoveries. Except at one\nend where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to\nevery unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of\nmatches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even\ndamp. I turned to Weena. \u2018Dance,\u2019 I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a\nweapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict\nmuseum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena\u2019s huge delight, I solemnly\nperformed a kind of composite dance, whistling The Land of the Leal as cheerfully as I\ncould. In part it was a modest cancan, in part a step dance, in part a skirt dance (so far\nas my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive, as you\nknow.\n\u201cNow, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for\nimmemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was a most fortunate, thing. Yet,\noddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a\nsealed jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at\nfirst that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of\ncamphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced\nto survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia\npainting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have\nperished and become fossilised millions of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but\nI remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame\u2014was, in\nfact, an excellent candle\u2014and I put it in my pocket. I found no explosives, however,\nnor any means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the\nmost helpful thing I had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.\n\u201cI cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would require a great effort\nof memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order. I remember a long\ngallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a\nhatchet or a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best\nagainst the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The most\n",
    "48": "were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still fairly sound. But any\ncartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw\nwas charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens.\nIn another place was a vast array of idols\u2014Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Ph\u0153nician,\nevery country on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I\nwrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that\nparticularly took my fancy.\n\u201cAs the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery after gallery,\ndusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite,\nsometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine,\nand then by the merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite\ncartridges! I shouted \u2018Eureka!\u2019 and smashed the case with joy. Then came a doubt. I\nhesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. I never felt such a\ndisappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that\nnever came. Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their\npresence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off\nincontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my chances of\nfinding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence.\n\u201cIt was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within the palace. It\nwas turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and refreshed ourselves. Towards\nsunset I began to consider our position. Night was creeping upon us, and my\ninaccessible hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little now. I\nhad in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the\nMorlocks\u2014I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed.\nIt seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,\nprotected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards\nthat, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very\ndifferently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,\nlargely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never impressed me as\nbeing very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the\nwork.\n",
    "49": "In the Darkness\n\u201cWe emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon. I\nwas determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere the dusk I\npurposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey.\nMy plan was to go as far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the\nprotection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or dried\ngrass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress\nwas slower than I had anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to\nsuffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood. Upon\nthe shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the darkness before us;\nbut a singular sense of impending calamity, that should indeed have served me as a\nwarning, drove me onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I\nwas feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.\n\u201cWhile we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against their\nblackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and long grass all about us,\nand I did not feel safe from their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was\nrather less than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it\nseemed to me, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my matches\nand my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet\nit was evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should have to\nabandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my\nhead that I would amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the\natrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for\ncovering our retreat.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the\nabsence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun\u2019s heat is rarely strong enough to\nburn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical\ndistricts. Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire.\nDecaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation, but\nthis rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been\nforgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an\naltogether new and strange thing to Weena.\n\u201cShe wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have cast herself into\nit had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and in spite of her struggles, plunged\nboldly before me into the wood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path.\nLooking back presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of\nsticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was\ncreeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again to the dark trees\nbefore me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still,\nas my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems.\nOverhead it was simply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon\nus here and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left\narm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.\n\u201cFor some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet, the faint\n",
    "50": "rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of the blood-vessels in\nmy ears. Then I seemed to know of a pattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The\npattering grew more distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had\nheard in the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and they were\nclosing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at my coat, then something\nat my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and became quite still.\n\u201cIt was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so, and, as I\nfumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness about my knees, perfectly\nsilent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft\nlittle hands, too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then\nthe match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the\nMorlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket,\nand prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She\nwas lying clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground. With a\nsudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of\ncamphor and flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back the\nMorlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of\nthe stir and murmur of a great company!\n\u201cShe seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push\non, and then there came a horrible realisation. In man\u0153uvring with my matches and\nWeena, I had turned myself about several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in\nwhat direction lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of\nGreen Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly what to do. I\ndetermined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I put Weena, still motionless,\ndown upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began\ncollecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks\u2019\neyes shone like carbuncles.\n\u201cThe camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so, two white forms\nthat had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away. One was so blinded by the\nlight that he came straight for me, and I felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist.\nHe gave a whoop of dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of\ncamphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was some of\nthe foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no\nrain had fallen. So, instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began\nleaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green\nwood and dry sticks, and could economise my camphor. Then I turned to where Weena\nlay beside my iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I\ncould not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\n\u201cNow, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made me heavy\nof a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air. My fire would not need\nreplenishing for an hour or so. I felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The\nwood, too, was full of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to\nnod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon me.\nFlinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box, and\u2014it\nhad gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had\nhappened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over\nmy soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck,\n",
    "51": "by the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the\ndarkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in a monstrous\nspider\u2019s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I\nrolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I\nstruggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short, I thrust\nwhere I judged their faces might be. I could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone\nunder my blows, and for a moment I was free.\n\u201cThe strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon\nme. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined to make the Morlocks\npay for their meat. I stood with my back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The\nwhole wood was full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices\nseemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet\nnone came within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope.\nWhat if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing.\nThe darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the Morlocks about\nme\u2014three battered at my feet\u2014and then I recognised, with incredulous surprise, that\nthe others were running, in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and\naway through the wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.\nAs I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the\nbranches, and vanish. And at that I understood the smell of burning wood, the\nslumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the\nMorlocks\u2019 flight.\n\u201cStepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the black\npillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was my first fire coming\nafter me. With that I looked for Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling\nbehind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for\nreflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks\u2019 path. It was a close race.\nOnce the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and\nhad to strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did\nso, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the\nfire!\n\u201cAnd now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of all that I beheld\nin that future age. This whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire.\nIn the centre was a hillock or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond\nthis was another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from\nit, completely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside were some\nthirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and blundering hither and\nthither against each other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realise their\nblindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they\napproached me, killing one and crippling several more. But when I had watched the\ngestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard\ntheir moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I\nstruck no more of them.\n\u201cYet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting loose a\nquivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time the flames died down\nsomewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me. I was\nthinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen; but\n",
    "52": "the fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among\nthem and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was gone.\n\u201cAt last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strange\nincredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making uncanny noises to\neach other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed\nacross the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they\nbelonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came\nblundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did so.\n\u201cFor the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I bit myself\nand screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the ground with my hands, and\ngot up and sat down again, and wandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I\nwould fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw\nMorlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last,\nabove the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke and the\nwhitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim\ncreatures, came the white light of the day.\n\u201cI searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was plain that they\nhad left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot describe how it relieved me to think\nthat it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I\nwas almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I\ncontained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in the forest. From its\nsummit I could now make out through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain,\nand from that I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the\nremnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day\ngrew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and\namong black stems that still pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of\nthe Time Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I\nfelt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed an\noverwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a\ndream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely again\u2014terribly\nalone. I began to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with\nsuch thoughts came a longing that was pain.\n\u201cBut, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky, I made a\ndiscovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches. The box must have\nleaked before it was lost.\n",
    "53": "The Trap of the White Sphinx\n\u201cAbout eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow metal from\nwhich I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival. I thought of my hasty\nconclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my\nconfidence. Here was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same\nsplendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its\nfertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among\nthe trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that\nsuddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the\ncupolas above the ways to the Underworld. I understood now what all the beauty of\nthe Overworld people covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of\nthe cattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no\nneeds. And their end was the same.\n\u201cI grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been. It had\ncommitted suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease, a balanced\nsociety with security and permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes\u2014to\ncome to this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety.\nThe rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and\nwork. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social\nquestion left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.\n\u201cIt is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensation\nfor change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environment\nis a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct\nare useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change.\nOnly those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs\nand dangers.\n\u201cSo, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness, and\nthe Underworld to mere mechanical industry. But that perfect state had lacked one\nthing even for mechanical perfection\u2014absolute permanency. Apparently as time went\non, the feeding of an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed.\nMother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years, came back again,\nand she began below. The Underworld being in contact with machinery, which,\nhowever perfect, still needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained\nperforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human character, than the Upper.\nAnd when other meat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto\nforbidden. So I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two\nThousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit\ncould invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I give it to you.\n\u201cAfter the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in spite of my\ngrief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant. I was\nvery tired and sleepy, and soon my theorising passed into dozing. Catching myself at\nthat, I took my own hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and\nrefreshing sleep.\n\u201cI awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being caught napping by\n",
    "54": "the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down the hill towards the White\nSphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and the other hand played with the matches in\nmy pocket.\n\u201cAnd now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of the\nsphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into grooves.\n\u201cAt that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\n\u201cWithin was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of this was the\nTime Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So here, after all my elaborate\npreparations for the siege of the White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron\nbar away, almost sorry not to use it.\n\u201cA sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal. For once, at\nleast, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks. Suppressing a strong inclination\nto laugh, I stepped through the bronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was\nsurprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the\nMorlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its\npurpose.\n\u201cNow as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the\ncontrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze panels suddenly slid up\nand struck the frame with a clang. I was in the dark\u2014trapped. So the Morlocks\nthought. At that I chuckled gleefully.\n\u201cI could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me. Very\ncalmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a\nghost. But I had overlooked one little thing. The matches were of that abominable kind\nthat light only on the box.\n\u201cYou may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close upon me.\nOne touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers, and\nbegan to scramble into the saddle of the machine. Then came one hand upon me and\nthen another. Then I had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers,\nand at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they\nalmost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark with\nmy head\u2014I could hear the Morlock\u2019s skull ring\u2014to recover it. It was a nearer thing\nthan the fight in the forest, I think, this last scramble.\n\u201cBut at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands slipped from\nme. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found myself in the same grey light\nand tumult I have already described.\n",
    "55": "The Further Vision\n\u201cI have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time\ntravelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sideways and in\nan unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung to the machine as it swayed and\nvibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials\nagain I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records days, and another\nthousands of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions. Now,\ninstead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them,\nand when I came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was\nsweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch\u2014into futurity.\n\u201cAs I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things. The\npalpitating greyness grew darker; then\u2014though I was still travelling with prodigious\nvelocity\u2014the blinking succession of day and night, which was usually indicative of a\nslower pace, returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at\nfirst. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the passage\nof the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through centuries. At last a\nsteady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a\ncomet glared across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the sun had\nlong since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set\u2014it simply rose and fell in the\nwest, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The\ncircling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of\nlight. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless\nupon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering a\nmomentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly\nagain, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this slowing down of\nits rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to\nrest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very\ncautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse my motion.\nSlower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless\nand the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim\noutlines of a desolate beach grew visible.\n\u201cI stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round. The sky was\nno longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shone\nbrightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and\nstarless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the\nhorizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a\nharsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely\ngreen vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It was\nthe same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which\nlike these grow in a perpetual twilight.\n\u201cThe machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to the\nsouth-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky. There were no\nbreakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell\nrose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving\n",
    "56": "and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick\nincrustation of salt\u2014pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my\nhead, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me of my\nonly experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied\nthan it is now.\n\u201cFar away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing like a huge\nwhite butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and, circling, disappear over\nsome low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and\nseated myself more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,\nquite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards\nme. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you imagine a\ncrab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big\nclaws swaying, its long antenn\u00e6, like carters\u2019 whips, waving and feeling, and its\nstalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front? Its back was\ncorrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation\nblotched it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth\nflickering and feeling as it moved.\n\u201cAs I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a tickling on my\ncheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to brush it away with my hand, but in a\nmoment it returned, and almost immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this,\nand caught something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a\nfrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of another monster\ncrab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks, its mouth\nwas all alive with appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,\nwere descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a\nmonth between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach, and I\nsaw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling\nhere and there, in the sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.\n\u201cI cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world. The\nred eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea, the stony beach crawling\nwith these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the\nlichenous plants, the thin air that hurts one\u2019s lungs: all contributed to an appalling\neffect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same red sun\u2014a little larger, a\nlittle duller\u2014the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same crowd of earthy\ncrustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the\nwestward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.\n\u201cSo I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a thousand years or\nmore, drawn on by the mystery of the earth\u2019s fate, watching with a strange fascination\nthe sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb\naway. At last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun\nhad come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I stopped once\nmore, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for\nits livid green liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with\nwhite. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down.\nTo the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky, and I\ncould see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along\nthe sea margin, with drifting masses farther out; but the main expanse of that salt\n",
    "57": "ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.\n\u201cI looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A certain indefinable\napprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine. But I saw nothing moving, in\nearth or sky or sea. The green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not\nextinct. A shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from\nthe beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but it\nbecame motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye had been deceived, and\nthat the black object was merely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and\nseemed to me to twinkle very little.\n\u201cSuddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed; that\na concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this grow larger. For a minute\nperhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I\nrealised that an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was\npassing across the sun\u2019s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is\nmuch to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner planet\npassing very near to the earth.\n\u201cThe darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the\neast, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number. From the edge of\nthe sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent.\nSilent? It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating\nof sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background of\nour lives\u2014all that was over. As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more\nabundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At last, one by\none, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into\nblackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the\neclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All\nelse was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.\n\u201cA horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my marrow,\nand the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and a deadly nausea seized\nme. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the\nmachine to recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I\nstood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal\u2014there was no\nmistake now that it was a moving thing\u2014against the red water of the sea. It was a\nround thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles trailed\ndown from it; it seemed black against the weltering blood-red water, and it was\nhopping fitfully about. Then I felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless\nin that remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.\n",
    "58": "The Time Traveller\u2019s Return\n\u201cSo I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the machine. The\nblinking succession of the days and nights was resumed, the sun got golden again, the\nsky blue. I breathed with greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed\nand flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim\nshadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and\npassed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero, I slackened\nspeed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands\nhand ran back to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower. Then\nthe old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently, now, I slowed the\nmechanism down.\n\u201cI saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you that when I set\nout, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett had walked across the room,\ntravelling, as it seemed to me, like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that\nminute when she traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be\nthe exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened, and she\nglided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and disappeared behind the door by\nwhich she had previously entered. Just before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a\nmoment; but he passed like a flash.\n\u201cThen I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory,\nmy tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off the thing very shakily, and sat\ndown upon my bench. For several minutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer.\nAround me was my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept\nthere, and the whole thing have been a dream.\n\u201cAnd yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner of the\nlaboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against the wall where you saw\nit. That gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White\nSphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.\n\u201cFor a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through the\npassage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I\nsaw the Pall Mall Gazette on the table by the door. I found the date was indeed today,\nand looking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o\u2019clock. I heard your\nvoices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated\u2014I felt so sick and weak. Then I sniffed good\nwholesome meat, and opened the door on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined,\nand now I am telling you the story.\n",
    "59": "After the Story\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, after a pause, \u201cthat all this will be absolutely incredible to you,\nbut to me the one incredible thing is that I am here tonight in this old familiar room\nlooking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures.\u201d He looked at\nthe Medical Man. \u201cNo. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie\u2014or a prophecy.\nSay I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies\nof our race, until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its truth as a mere\nstroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?\u201d\nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap with it\nnervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary stillness. Then chairs\nbegan to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet. I took my eyes off the Time\nTraveller\u2019s face, and looked round at his audience. They were in the dark, and little\nspots of colour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the\ncontemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar\u2014the\nsixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I remember, were\nmotionless.\nThe Editor stood up with a sigh. \u201cWhat a pity it is you\u2019re not a writer of stories!\u201d he\nsaid, putting his hand on the Time Traveller\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI thought not.\u201d\nThe Time Traveller turned to us. \u201cWhere are the matches?\u201d he said. He lit one and\nspoke over his pipe, puffing. \u201cTo tell you the truth... I hardly believe it myself..... And\nyet...\u201d\nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the little\ntable. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I saw he was looking at some\nhalf-healed scars on his knuckles.\nThe Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. \u201cThe\ngyn\u00e6ceum\u2019s odd,\u201d he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see, holding out his hand\nfor a specimen.\n\u201cI\u2019m hanged if it isn\u2019t a quarter to one,\u201d said the Journalist. \u201cHow shall we get\nhome?\u201d\n\u201cPlenty of cabs at the station,\u201d said the Psychologist.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a curious thing,\u201d said the Medical Man; \u201cbut I certainly don\u2019t know the natural\norder of these flowers. May I have them?\u201d\nThe Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: \u201cCertainly not.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you really get them?\u201d said the Medical Man.\nThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was trying to\nkeep hold of an idea that eluded him. \u201cThey were put into my pocket by Weena, when I\ntravelled into Time.\u201d He stared round the room. \u201cI\u2019m damned if it isn\u2019t all going. This\nroom and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever\nmake a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say\n",
    "60": "life is a dream, a precious poor dream at times\u2014but I can\u2019t stand another that won\u2019t fit.\nIt\u2019s madness. And where did the dream come from? \u2026 I must look at that machine. If\nthere is one!\u201d\nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the door into the\ncorridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine\nsure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent\nglimmering quartz. Solid to the touch\u2014for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it\u2014\nand with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon the\nlower parts, and one rail bent awry.\nThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand along the\ndamaged rail. \u201cIt\u2019s all right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story I told you was true. I\u2019m sorry to\nhave brought you out here in the cold.\u201d He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute\nsilence, we returned to the smoking-room.\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat. The Medical\nMan looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told him he was suffering from\noverwork, at which he laughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway,\nbawling good-night.\nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a \u201cgaudy lie.\u201d For my own part I\nwas unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so fantastic and incredible, the\ntelling so credible and sober. I lay awake most of the night thinking about it. I\ndetermined to go next day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the\nlaboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,\nhowever, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put out my hand\nand touched the lever. At that the squat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough\nshaken by the wind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer\nreminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back\nthrough the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He was coming\nfrom the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other.\nHe laughed when he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. \u201cI\u2019m frightfully busy,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cwith that thing in there.\u201d\n\u201cBut is it not some hoax?\u201d I said. \u201cDo you really travel through time?\u201d\n\u201cReally and truly I do.\u201d And he looked frankly into my eyes. He hesitated. His eye\nwandered about the room. \u201cI only want half an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cI know why you came,\nand it\u2019s awfully good of you. There\u2019s some magazines here. If you\u2019ll stop to lunch I\u2019ll\nprove you this time travelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you\u2019ll forgive my\nleaving you now?\u201d\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words, and he\nnodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the laboratory slam, seated\nmyself in a chair, and took up a daily paper. What was he going to do before lunch-\ntime? Then suddenly I was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet\nRichardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely\nsave that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the Time Traveller.\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly truncated at\nthe end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled round me as I opened the door,\nand from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time\nTraveller was not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling\n",
    "61": "mass of black and brass for a moment\u2014a figure so transparent that the bench behind\nwith its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I\nrubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the\nfurther end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had, apparently, just\nbeen blown in.\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had happened,\nand for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be. As I stood\nstaring, the door into the garden opened, and the man-servant appeared.\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. \u201cHas Mr. \u2014\u2014 gone out that\nway?\u201d said I.\n\u201cNo, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him here.\u201d\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed on, waiting\nfor the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still stranger story, and the\nspecimens and photographs he would bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear\nthat I must wait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as\neverybody knows now, he has never returned.\n",
    "62": "Epilogue\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he swept back\ninto the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age of\nUnpolished Stone; into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque\nsaurians, the huge reptilian brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now\u2014if I may\nuse the phrase\u2014be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or\nbeside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward, into one of the\nnearer ages, in which men are still men, but with the riddles of our own time answered\nand its wearisome problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own\npart, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory, and\nmutual discord are indeed man\u2019s culminating time! I say, for my own part. He, I know\n\u2014for the question had been discussed among us long before the Time Machine was\nmade\u2014thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the\ngrowing pile of civilisation only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon\nand destroy its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as though it\nwere not so. But to me the future is still black and blank\u2014is a vast ignorance, lit at a\nfew casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for my comfort, two\nstrange white flowers\u2014shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle\u2014to witness\nthat even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still\nlived on in the heart of man.\n"
