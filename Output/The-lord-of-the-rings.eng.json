    "11": "The revised text first appeared in Great Britain in a three-volume\nhardcover \u2018Second Edition\u2019 from Allen & Unwin on 27 October 1966.\nBut again there were problems. Although the revisions Tolkien sent\nto America of the text itself were available to be utilized in the new\nBritish edition, his extensive revisions to the appendices were lost\nafter being entered into the Ballantine edition. Allen & Unwin were\nforced to reset the appendices using the copy as published in the first\nBallantine edition. This did not include Tolkien\u2019s second, small set\nof revisions sent to Ballantine; but, more significantly, it did include\na great number of errors and omissions, many of which were not\ndiscovered until long afterwards. Thus, in the appendices, a close\nscrutiny of the first edition text and of the much later corrected\nimpressions of the second edition is necessary to discern whether any\nparticular change in this edition is authorial or erroneous.\nIn America, the revised text appeared in hardcover in the three-\nvolume edition published by Houghton Mifflin on 27 February 1967.\nThis text was evidently photo-offset from the 1966 Allen & Unwin\nthree-volume hardcover, and is thus consistent with it. Aside from\nthe first printing of this second Houghton Mifflin edition, which has\na 1967 date on the title page, none of the many reprintings is dated.\nAfter the initial printings of this edition, which bore a 1966 copyright\nnotice, the date of copyright was changed in 1965 to match the state-\nment in the Ballantine edition. This change has caused a great deal\nof confusion for librarians and other researchers who have tried to\nsort out the sequence of publication of these editions.\nMeanwhile, Tolkien spent much of the summer of 1966 further\nrevising the text. In June he learned that any more revisions were too\nlate for inclusion in the 1966 Allen & Unwin second edition, and he\nrecorded in his diary: \u2018But I am attempting to complete my work [on\nthe revisions] \u2013 I cannot leave it while it is all in my mind. So much\ntime has been wasted in all my work by this constant breaking of\nthreads.\u2019 This was the last major set of revisions Tolkien himself\nmade to the text during his lifetime. They were added to the second\nimpression (1967) of the three-volume hardcover Allen & Unwin\nsecond edition. The revisions themselves mostly include corrections\nof nomenclature and attempts at consistency of usage throughout the\nthree volumes. Some small alterations were made by Tolkien in the\n1969 one-volume India paper edition.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien died in 1973. His third son and literary executor,\nChristopher Tolkien, sent a large number of further corrections of\nmisprints, mainly in the appendices and index, to Allen & Unwin\nfor use in their editions in 1974. Most of these corrections were\ntypographical, and in line with his father\u2019s expressed intent in his\nown check copies.",
    "12": "Since 1974, Christopher Tolkien has sent additional corrections,\nas errors have been discovered, to the British publishers of The Lord\nof the Rings (Allen & Unwin, later Unwin Hyman, and now Harper-\nCollins), who have tried to be conscientious in the impossible task\nof maintaining a textual integrity in whichever editions of The Lord\nof the Rings they have published. However, every time the text has\nbeen reset for publication in a new format (e.g. the various paperback\neditions published in England in the 1970s and 1980s), huge numbers\nof new misprints have crept in, though at times some of these errors\nhave been observed and corrected in later printings. Still, throughout\nthese years the three-volume British hardcover edition has retained\nthe highest textual integrity.\nIn the United States, the text of the Ballantine paperback has\nremained unchanged for more than three decades after Tolkien added\nhis few revisions in 1966. The text in all of the Houghton Mifflin\neditions remained unchanged from 1967 until 1987, when Houghton\nMifflin photo-offset the then current three-volume British hardcover\nedition in order to update the text used in their editions. In those new\nreprintings a number of further corrections (overseen by Christopher\nTolkien) were added, and the errant Ballantine branch of revision\n(including the \u2018Estella Bolger\u2019 addition) was integrated into the main\nbranch of textual descent. This method of correction involved a cut-\nand-paste process with printed versions of the text. Beginning with\nthe 1987 Houghton Mifflin edition, an earlier version of this \u2018Note\non the Text\u2019 (dated October 1986) was added to The Lord of the\nRings. This \u2018Note\u2019 has been reworked three times since then \u2013 the\nversion dated April 1993 first appeared in 1994, and the version dated\nApril 2002 came out later that year. The present \u2018Note\u2019 replaces and\nsupersedes all previous versions.\nFor the 1994 British edition published by HarperCollins, the text\nof The Lord of the Rings was entered into word-processing files. This\nnext stage of textual evolution came about to allow for a greater\nuniformity of the text in all future editions, but with it, inevitably,\ncame new wrinkles. Some new misreadings entered into the text,\nwhile at the same time others were fixed. In the worst instance, one\nline of the ring inscription in the chapter \u2018The Shadow of the Past\u2019 of\nThe Fellowship of the Ring was simply dropped. Unforeseeable glitches\narose in other editions when the base computerized text was trans-\nferred into page-making or typesetting programs \u2013 e.g., in one edition\nof The Fellowship of the Ring, the closing two sentences of \u2018The Council\nof Elrond\u2019 simply and inexplicably disappeared. Such glitches have\nbeen very much the exception, not the rule, and the text has otherwise\nmaintained a consistency and integrity throughout its computerized\nevolution.",
    "13": "The 1994 edition also contained a number of new corrections\n(again supervised by Christopher Tolkien), as well as a reconfigured\nindex of names and page references. The 1994 text was first used in\nAmerican editions published by Houghton Mifflin in 1999. A small\nnumber of further corrections were added into the 2002 three-volume\nedition illustrated by Alan Lee, published by HarperCollins in Great\nBritain and Houghton Mifflin in the United States.\nThe textual history of The Lord of the Rings, merely in its published\nform, is a vast and complex web. In this brief note I have given only\na glimpse of the overall sequence and structure. Further details on\nthe revisions and corrections made over the years to the published\ntext of The Lord of the Rings, and a fuller account of its publishing\nhistory, may be found in J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography,\nby Wayne G. Hammond, with the assistance of Douglas A. Anderson\n(1993).\nFor those interested in observing the gradual evolving of The Lord\nof the Rings from its earliest drafts to its published form, I highly\nrecommend Christopher Tolkien\u2019s account, which appears within\nfive volumes of his twelve-volume series The History of Middle-earth.\nVolumes six through nine contain the major part of his study per-\ntaining to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Shadow (1988); The\nTreason of Isengard (1989); The War of the Ring (1990); and Sauron\nDefeated (1992). Also, the final book of the series, The Peoples of\nMiddle-earth (1996), covers the evolution of the prologue and appen-\ndices to The Lord of the Rings. These volumes contain an engrossing\nover-the-shoulder account of the growth and writing of Tolkien\u2019s\nmasterpiece.\nThe process of studying Tolkien\u2019s manuscripts of The Lord of the\nRings involved the deciphering of versions where Tolkien wrote first\nin pencil and then in ink atop the pencilled draft. Christopher Tolkien\nhas decribed his father\u2019s method of composition in The Return of the\nShadow: \u2018In the handwriting that he used for rapid drafts and\nsketches, not intended to endure long before he turned to them again\nand gave them a more workable form, letters are so loosely formed\nthat a word which cannot be deduced or guessed at from the context\nor from later versions can prove perfectly opaque after long examin-\nation; and if, as he often did, he used a soft pencil much has now\nbecome blurred and faint.\u2019 The true difficulty of reading such double-\ndrafts can be observed in the frontispiece to The War of the Ring,\nwhich reproduces in colour Tolkien\u2019s illustration of \u2018Shelob\u2019s Lair\u2019\nfrom a page of Tolkien\u2019s manuscript. Looking very closely at the\nhasty ink draft alongside the illustration, one can see underneath\nit the earlier, hastier, pencilled draft. Also in The War of the Ring,",
    "14": "Christopher Tolkien reproduces a page from the first manuscript of\nthe chapter \u2018The Taming of Sme\u00b4agol\u2019, and the printed text corre-\nsponding to this text is on the facing page (see pp. 90\u201391). One is\nastonished at anyone\u2019s ability to decipher such texts.\nThat difficulty aside, just what do these books signify to ordinary\nreaders and to Tolkien scholars? And what is \u2018the history of the\nwriting\u2019 of a book? Simply, these volumes show in great detail the\ndevelopment of the story of The Lord of the Rings from its very earliest\ndrafts and hasty projections through its completion. We see in the\nearliest materials what is very much a children\u2019s book, a sequel to\nThe Hobbit, and as the story grows through various \u2018phases\u2019, there is\nan increase in seriousness and depth. We see alternate branches of\ndevelopment, the gradual blending and merging of certain characters,\nand the slow emergence of the nature of the rings and of the motiv-\nations of other characters. Some of these various ideas are abandoned\naltogether, while others are reworked into some variant form that\nmay or may not survive into the final version.\nOne could make a whole catalogue of interesting tidbits from\nChristopher Tolkien\u2019s study \u2013 such as the fact that Strider was called\nTrotter until a very late stage in the writing of the book; that Trotter\nwas at one time a hobbit, so named because he wore wooden shoes;\nthat Tolkien at one point considered a romance between Aragorn\nand E\u00b4owyn; that Tolkien wrote an epilogue to the book, tying up\nloose ends, but it was dropped before publication (and now appears\nin Sauron Defeated ); and so on. But these developments are best\nappreciated when read within the context of Christopher Tolkien\u2019s\ncommentary rather than discussed separately.\nThe most significant achievement of these volumes is that they\nshow us how Tolkien wrote and thought. Nowhere else do we see\nthe authorial process itself at work in such detail. Tolkien\u2019s hastiest\ncomments about where the story might proceed, or why it can or\ncan\u2019t go such and such a way \u2013 these queries to himself were written\nout: Tolkien is literally thinking on paper. This gives an added dimen-\nsion of understanding to Tolkien\u2019s comment to Stanley Unwin in a\n1963 letter that, when suffering from trouble with his shoulder and\nright arm, \u2018I found not being able to use a pen or pencil as defeating\nas the loss of her beak would be to a hen.\u2019 And we, as readers\nof these volumes, can share with Tolkien himself the wonder and\nbewilderment of new characters appearing as if from nowhere, or of\nsome other sudden change or development, at the very moment of\ntheir emergence into the story.\nI know of no other instance in literature where we have such a\n\u2018history of the writing\u2019 of a book, told mostly by the author himself,\nwith all the hesitations and false paths laid out before us, sorted out,",
    "15": "commented upon, and served up to a reader like a feast. We are\nshown innumerable instances in the minutest detail of the thought-\nprocess itself at work. We see the author fully absorbed in creation\nfor its own sake. And this is all the more exceptional because this\nis a history not only of the unfolding of a story and its text, but of\nthe evolution of a world. There is an additional wealth of material\nbeyond simple narrative text. There are maps and illustrations. There\nare languages and writing systems, and the histories of the peoples\nwho spoke and wrote in these systems. All of these additional\nmaterials add multiple dimensions of complexity to our appreciation\nof the invented world itself.\nFifty years into the published life of The Lord of the Rings, it seems\nextraordinary to me that we have not only such a masterful work of\nliterature but also as a companion to it an unparalleled account of\nits writing.

    "16": "NOTE ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY\nEDITION\nIn this edition of The Lord of the Rings, prepared for the fiftieth\nanniversary of its publication, between three and four hundred emen-\ndations have been made following an exhaustive review of past\neditions and printings. The present text is based on the setting of\nthe HarperCollins three-volume hardcover edition of 2002, which in\nturn was a revision of the HarperCollins reset edition of 1994. As\nDouglas A. Anderson comments in the preceding \u2018Note on the Text\u2019,\neach of those editions was itself corrected, and each also introduced\nnew errors. At the same time, other errors survived undetected, among\nthem some five dozen which entered as long ago as 1954, in the resetting\nof The Fellowship of the Ring published as its \u2018second impression\u2019.\nThat the printer had quietly reset The Fellowship of the Ring, and\nthat copies had been issued without proof having been read by the\nauthor, never became known to Tolkien; while his publisher, Rayner\nUnwin, learned of it only thirty-eight years after the fact. Tolkien\nfound a few of the unauthorized changes introduced in the second\nprinting when (probably while preparing the second edition in 1965)\nhe read a copy of the twelfth impression (1962), but thought the\nerrors newly made. These, among others, were corrected in the course\nof the reprinting. Then in 1992 Eric Thompson, a reader with a keen\neye for typographic detail, noticed small differences between the first\nand second impressions of The Fellowship of the Ring and called them\nto the attention of the present editors. About one-sixth of the errors\nthat entered in the second printing quickly came to light. Many more\nwere revealed only recently, when Steven M. Frisby used ingenious\noptical aids to make a comparison of copies of The Lord of the Rings\nin greater detail than was previously accomplished. We have gladly\nmade full use of Mr Frisby\u2019s results, which he has generously shared\nand discussed.\nIn the course of its fifty-year history The Lord of the Rings has had\nmany such readers who have recorded changes made between its\nvarious appearances in print, both to document what has gone before\nand to aid in the achievement of an authoritative text. Errors or\npossible errors were reported to the author himself or to his pub-\nlishers, and information on the textual history of the work circulated\namong Tolkien enthusiasts at least as early as 1966, when Banks",

Anderson\nhas been in the forefront of efforts to achieve an accurate text of The\nLord of the Rings (and of The Hobbit); Christina Scull has published\n\u2018A Preliminary Study of Variations in Editions of The Lord of the\nRings\u2019in Beyond Bree (April and August 1985); Wayne G. Hammond\nhas compiled extensive lists of textual changes in J.R.R. Tolkien: A\nDescriptive Bibliography (1993); and David Bratman has published an\nimportant article, \u2018A Corrigenda to The Lord of the Rings\u2019, in the\nMarch 1994 number of The Tolkien Collector. The observations of\nDainis Bisenieks, Yuval Kfir, Charles Noad, and other readers, sent\nto us directly or posted in public forums, have also been of service.\nEfforts such as these follow the example of the author of The Lord\nof the Rings during his lifetime. His concern for the textual accuracy\nand coherence of his work is evident from the many emendations he\nmade in later printings, and from notes he made for other emen-\ndations which for one reason or another have not previously (or have\nonly partly) been put into effect. Even late in life, when such labours\nwearied him, his feelings were clear. On 30 October 1967 he wrote\nto Joy Hill at George Allen & Unwin, concerning a reader\u2019s query\nhe had received about points in the Appendices to The Lord of the\nRings: \u2018Personally I have ceased to bother about these minor \u2018\u2018discrep-\nancies\u2019\u2019, since if the genealogies and calendars etc. lack verisimilitude\nit is in their general excessive accuracy: as compared with real annals\nor genealogies! Anyway the slips were few, have now mostly been\nremoved, and the discovery of what remain seems an amusing pas-\ntime! But errors in the text are another matter\u2019 (italics ours). In fact\nTolkien had not \u2018ceased to bother\u2019, and \u2018slips\u2019 were dealt with as\nopportunities arose. These, and the indulgence of his publisher,\nallowed Tolkien a luxury few authors enjoy: multiple chances not\nonly to correct his text but to improve it, and to further develop the\nlanguages, geography, and peoples of Middle-earth.\nThe fiftieth anniversary of The Lord of the Rings seemed an ideal\nopportunity to consider the latest (2002) text in light of information\nwe had gathered in the course of decades of work in Tolkien studies,\nwith Steve Frisby\u2019s research at hand, and with an electronic copy\nof The Lord of the Rings (supplied by HarperCollins) searchable by\nkeyword or phrase. The latter especially allowed us to develop lists\nof words that varied from one instance to another, and investigate\nvariations in usage, as they stood in the copy-text and relative to\nearlier editions and printings. Of course Tolkien wrote The Lord of\nthe Rings over so long a period of time, some eighteen years, that\ninconsistencies in its text were almost inevitable. Christopher Tolkien\neven observed to us that some apparent inconsistencies of form in his",
    "18": "father\u2019s work may even have been deliberate: for instance, although\nTolkien carefully distinguished house \u2018dwelling\u2019 from House \u2018noble\nfamily or dynasty\u2019, in two instances he used house in the latter sense\nbut in lower case, perhaps because a capital letter would have\ndetracted from the importance of the adjective with which the word\nwas paired (\u2018royal house\u2019, \u2018golden house\u2019). There can be no doubt,\nhowever, that Tolkien attempted to correct inconsistency, no less\nthan outright error, whenever it came to his attention, and it was our\nopinion, with the advice and agreement of Christopher Tolkien, that\nan attempt should be made to do so in the anniversary edition, in\nso far as we could carefully and conservatively distinguish what to\nemend.\nMany of the emendations in the present text are to marks of\npunctuation, either to correct recent typographical errors or to repair\nsurviving alterations introduced in the second printing of The Fellow-\nship of the Ring. In the latter respect and in every case, Tolkien\u2019s\noriginal punctuation is always more felicitous \u2013 subtle points, when\none is comparing commas and semi-colons, but no less a part of the\nauthor\u2019s intended expression. Distinctive words such as chill rather\nthan cold, and glistered rather than glistened, changed by typesetters\nlong ago without authorization, likewise have been restored. A\ncontrolled amount of regularization also seemed called for, such as\nnaught rather than nought, a change instituted by Tolkien but not\ncarried through in all instances; Dark Power rather than dark power\nwhen the reference is obviously to Sauron (or Morgoth); Barrow-\ndowns by Tolkien\u2019s preference rather than Barrowdowns; likewise Bree-\nhill rather than Bree Hill; accented and more common Dru\u00b4adan rather\nthan Druadan; capitalized names of seasons when used as personifi-\ncation or metaphor, according to Tolkien\u2019s predominant practice and\nthe internal logic of the text; and Elvish rather than elvish when used\nas a separate adjective, following a preference Tolkien marked in his\ncopy of the second edition of The Lord of the Rings. In addition, we\nhave added a second accent to Nu\u00b4meno\u00b4rean(s), as Tolkien often wrote\nthe name in manuscript and as it appears in The Silmarillion and\nother posthumous publications.\nThe result, nonetheless, still includes many variations in capital-\nization, punctuation, and other points of style. Not all of these are\nerroneous: they include words such as Sun, Moon, Hobbit, and Man\n(or sun, moon, hobbit, man), which may change form according to\nmeaning or application, in relation to adjacent adjectives, or whether\nTolkien intended personification, poetry, or emphasis. His intent\ncannot be divined with confidence in every case. But it is possible to\ndiscern Tolkien\u2019s preferences in many instances, from statements\nhe wrote in his check copies of The Lord of the Rings or from a",

But those inconsistencies of content, such\nas Gimli\u2019s famous (and erroneous) statement in Book III, Chapter 7,\n\u2018Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left Moria\u2019, which\nwould require rewriting to emend rather than simple correction,\nremain unchanged.\nSo many new emendations to The Lord of the Rings, and such an\nextensive review of its text, deserve to be fully documented. Although\nmost readers will be content with the text alone, many will want to\nknow more about the problems encountered in preparing this new\nedition, and their solutions (where solutions have been possible),\nespecially where the text has been emended, but also where it has\nnot. To this end, and to illuminate the work in other respects, we\nare preparing a volume of annotations to The Lord of the Rings for\npublication in 2005.

We will also explain archaic or unusual words\nand names in The Lord of the Rings, explore literary and historical\ninfluences, note connections with Tolkien\u2019s other writings, and com-\nment on differences between its drafts and published form, on ques-\ntions of language, and on much else that we hope will interest readers\nand enhance their enjoyment of Tolkien\u2019s masterpiece.\nWayne G.

    "20": "FOREWORD\nTO THE SECOND EDITION\nThis tale grew in the telling, until it became a history of the Great\nWar of the Ring and included many glimpses of the yet more ancient\nhistory that preceded it. It was begun soon after The Hobbit was\nwritten and before its publication in 1937; but I did not go on with\nthis sequel, for I wished first to complete and set in order the myth-\nology and legends of the Elder Days, which had then been taking\nshape for some years. I desired to do this for my own satisfaction,\nand I had little hope that other people would be interested in this\nwork, especially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and\nwas begun in order to provide the necessary background of \u2018history\u2019\nfor Elvish tongues.\nWhen those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected little hope\nto no hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged by requests from\nreaders for more information concerning hobbits and their adven-\ntures. But the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older world,\nand became an account, as it were, of its end and passing away before\nits beginning and middle had been told. The process had begun in\nthe writing of The Hobbit, in which there were already some references\nto the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and the orcs,\nas well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or\ndeeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, the Necro-\nmancer, the Ring. The discovery of the significance of these glimpses\nand of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the Third Age\nand its culmination in the War of the Ring.\nThose who had asked for more information about hobbits eventu-\nally got it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of\nThe Lord of the Rings went on at intervals during the years 1936 to\n1949, a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect,\nand many other interests as a learner and teacher that often absorbed\nme. The delay was, of course, also increased by the outbreak of war\nin 1939, by the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the\nend of Book One. In spite of the darkness of the next five years I\nfound that the story could not now be wholly abandoned, and I\nplodded on, mostly by night, till I stood by Balin\u2019s tomb in Moria.\nThere I halted for a long while. It was almost a year later when I\nwent on and so came to Lothlo\u00b4 rien and the Great River late in 1941."
